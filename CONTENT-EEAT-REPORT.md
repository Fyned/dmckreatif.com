## Page-by-Page Content Analysis

### Homepage
- **Word count (JS):** ~400 words visible (hero + stats + section titles)
- **Word count (noscript):** ~800 words (post-fix)
- **Minimum:** 500 | **Status:** JS content borderline, noscript OK
- **Issues:** Content is mostly UI labels and short taglines. No substantive paragraphs explaining what DMC Kreatif does in the main JS-rendered content. Hero text is just "WE BUILD WEBSITES THAT CONVERT" — no elaboration.

### Services Page
- **Word count:** ~300 words (feature bullets + process steps)
- **Minimum:** 800 | **Status:** BELOW MINIMUM
- **Issues:** Service descriptions are 1-2 sentences each. No in-depth explanation of deliverables, methodology, or outcomes. Process section has 4 steps of ~15 words each. FAQ section helps but answers are short.

### About Page
- **Word count:** ~250 words (bio + mission + values)
- **Minimum:** 500 | **Status:** BELOW MINIMUM
- **Issues:** Founder bio is 1 sentence. Values are just titles + 1-line descriptions. Timeline has good structure but thin content. No detailed story, no "why we started", no differentiator explanation.

### Portfolio Page
- **Word count:** ~100 words (filters + UI labels only)
- **Minimum:** 500 | **Status:** FAR BELOW MINIMUM
- **Issues:** Portfolio page is entirely UI components with no introductory content about the portfolio, methodology, or approach. Project cards only show on interaction.

### Pricing Page
- **Word count:** ~800 words (package details + FAQ + comparison table)
- **Minimum:** 800 | **Status:** OK
- **Issues:** Good feature breakdown. FAQ answers are concise and helpful. Comparison table is AI-friendly.

### Blog Posts
- **Word count per post:** ~100-150 words each
- **Minimum:** 1,500 | **Status:** CRITICALLY BELOW MINIMUM
- **Issues:** Blog "posts" are single paragraphs stored in translation keys. Post1 content is ~120 words. These are thin content by any standard. Google may classify these as doorway/thin pages.

### Contact Page
- **Word count:** ~150 words (form labels + info)
- **Minimum:** 300 | **Status:** BELOW MINIMUM
- **Issues:** Mostly form fields. No contextual content about the consultation process, response times, or what to expect.

## Critical Content Issues

### 1. CRITICAL: Blog Posts Are Thin Content (120-150 words each)
15 blog posts averaging ~120 words each. Google's Helpful Content signals will likely classify these as low-quality. This can drag down the entire domain's quality perception.

**Recommendation:** Either expand each post to 1,500+ words with proper structure, or remove the blog entirely until real content is ready. Thin blog posts are worse than no blog.

### 2. HIGH: No Author Bio/Credentials Page
Musa Kerem Demirci is referenced but has no dedicated profile page with credentials, experience history, certifications, or portfolio of personal work. E-E-A-T requires demonstrable expertise.

**Recommendation:** Create an `/about/founder` page or expand the About page with a detailed bio section including years of experience, notable projects, education, and links to LinkedIn/GitHub.

### 3. HIGH: Service Pages Lack Depth
Service descriptions are 1-2 sentences. For YMYL-adjacent content (pricing, business services), Google expects comprehensive information.

**Recommendation:** Add 200-300 word descriptions per service with: what's included, how it works, expected outcomes, timeline, and a relevant case study reference.

### 4. MEDIUM: Zero External Citations
No blog post or service page cites external sources (studies, industry reports, Google documentation). This weakens expertise signals.

**Recommendation:** Add 2-3 credible external links per blog post (Google documentation, industry studies, W3C standards).

### 5. MEDIUM: Stats May Be Inflated
- Hero shows "48+ Projects" and "44+ Countries" but portfolio only has ~11 projects across 4 countries
- About page shows "10+ Projects" and "4 Countries" which is more accurate
- Inconsistency between pages undermines trustworthiness

**Recommendation:** Align all statistics across the site. Use the same numbers everywhere.

### 6. LOW: No Content Freshness Signals on Service Pages
Service and pricing pages have no publication or last-updated dates. Blog posts have dates but stop at July 2025 (7 months old).

**Recommendation:** Add "Last updated: February 2026" to service/pricing pages. Publish new blog content or update existing posts with current dates.

## Top 5 Action Items (Priority Order)

1. **Fix or remove thin blog posts** — Either expand to 1,500+ words or delete. Thin content actively hurts domain quality. (Impact: HIGH)

2. **Expand service page descriptions** — Add 200-300 word blocks per service with deliverables, process, and outcomes. (Impact: HIGH)

3. **Create founder credentials section** — Detailed bio with experience, skills, and cross-platform links on the About page. (Impact: MEDIUM)

4. **Align statistics across pages** — Pick accurate numbers and use them consistently. (Impact: MEDIUM)

5. **Add external citations to blog posts** — If keeping the blog, link to authoritative sources in each post. (Impact: MEDIUM)

---

## Summary

The site has strong **trustworthiness** signals (HTTPS, real clients, real project URLs, GDPR compliance) and decent **experience** evidence (case studies with metrics). However, **expertise** is undermined by thin content across all pages, and **authoritativeness** is very weak due to zero external platform presence.

The most damaging issue is the blog: 15 posts at ~120 words each are a net negative for SEO. Either invest in real long-form content or remove the blog section until quality content is ready.
