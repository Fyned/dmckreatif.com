Every project starts with a deep-dive into your brand, audience and business goals so the final product reflects who you are — not a generic template. Our development stack centres on React, Next.js and Vite, giving you server-side rendering for SEO, instant page transitions and code-splitting that keeps initial load times under 1.5 seconds. Each site is fully responsive from mobile to ultra-wide, scores 95+ on Google Lighthouse across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO, and ships with structured data markup so search engines understand your content from day one. We wire up contact forms, analytics dashboards and CRM integrations, then hand you a live staging link for weekly review. After launch you receive 30 days of priority support, full source-code ownership and documentation so your team — or any developer — can maintain the site independently. Whether you need a single landing page or a multi-language corporate presence across France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, we deliver on time and on budget.",

Inventory syncs in real time, multi-currency pricing adjusts automatically and tax rules comply with EU VAT regulations out of the box. The admin panel lets you manage products, track orders, apply discount codes and generate sales reports without touching code. We integrate shipping calculators, abandoned-cart recovery emails and review systems that build social proof. On the technical side, product pages are pre-rendered for instant Google indexing, structured data powers rich search results and image optimisation keeps page weight low. Every store is fully responsive, supports four languages by default and includes 30 days of post-launch support plus staff training on the admin dashboard.

On-page optimisation covers meta titles, descriptions, heading hierarchy, image alt text and schema markup for rich results. We set up Google Search Console and Analytics 4 so you can track impressions, clicks, rankings and conversions in real time. For ongoing clients we deliver monthly performance reports with clear action items: new content recommendations, backlink opportunities and competitor gap analysis. Our approach is data-driven and transparent — no black-hat tricks, no vanity metrics, just measurable organic growth. Clients typically see a 40-120 % increase in organic traffic within the first six months. Whether you need a one-time audit or continuous optimisation, we tailor the scope to your budget and goals.",

We build component-driven applications that are fast to develop, easy to maintain, and performant at scale. Every React project we deliver follows strict architectural patterns that keep your codebase clean as your business grows.\n\nOur React development process starts with architecture planning. We define your component hierarchy, state management approach, and data flow before writing a single line of code. Using TypeScript throughout, we catch errors at compile time rather than in production. Our component library approach means common UI patterns are built once and reused consistently, giving your application a cohesive look and feel while reducing development time.\n\nWe specialise in React 18 features including concurrent rendering, automatic batching, and transitions. For state management, we use Zustand for its simplicity and performance, avoiding the boilerplate overhead of Redux. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI primitives, giving us full design control without fighting CSS specificity issues. Framer Motion powers our animations with gesture support and layout animations that make your app feel polished and responsive.\n\nPerformance is built into every decision. We implement code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense boundaries so users only download the code they need. Image optimisation, memoisation strategies, and virtual scrolling for large datasets ensure your app stays fast regardless of content volume. Every project targets 95+ on Google Lighthouse across all four categories.\n\nFor European businesses, we build with internationalisation from the start using react-i18next. Your React application can serve customers in English, French, Dutch, and German with proper RTL support if needed. We handle locale-specific formatting for dates, numbers, and currencies. GDPR compliance is woven into the architecture with consent management, data minimisation patterns, and secure API communication.\n\nOur React projects include comprehensive testing with Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for end-to-end testing. We set up CI/CD pipelines that run tests automatically on every commit, deploy to staging for review, and promote to production with zero downtime.

Built on top of React, Next.js gives us server-side rendering, static site generation, and edge computing capabilities that make your website both fast for users and visible to search engines. We have delivered dozens of Next.js projects for businesses across France, the UK, Belgium, and the Netherlands.\n\nOur Next.js development leverages the latest App Router architecture introduced in Next.js 14. This gives us nested layouts, streaming server components, and granular caching control. Server components reduce the JavaScript sent to the browser by rendering on the server, which means faster page loads and better Core Web Vitals scores. We use client components strategically only where interactivity is needed.\n\nFor content-heavy websites, we implement static generation at build time with incremental static regeneration for pages that change frequently. Product pages, blog posts, and landing pages are pre-rendered as HTML, served from a CDN, and revalidated on a schedule you define. This approach gives you the speed of a static site with the flexibility of a dynamic one.\n\nOur Next.js projects come with built-in internationalisation using the middleware-based routing pattern. Each language gets its own URL structure with proper hreflang tags, localised metadata, and culturally adapted content. We handle locale detection, cookie-based preferences, and fallback strategies so every visitor sees content in their preferred language.\n\nEdge functions and API routes let us build full-stack features without a separate backend. Contact forms, newsletter signups, webhook handlers, and authentication flows all run at the edge, close to your users across Europe. We integrate with Supabase for database needs, Stripe for payments, and Resend for transactional email.\n\nEvery Next.js site we build scores 95+ on Lighthouse, loads in under 2 seconds globally, and passes Core Web Vitals assessment. We deploy to Vercel or your preferred hosting platform with preview deployments for every pull request, so you can review changes before they go live.

Every project we build uses TypeScript in strict mode, catching entire categories of bugs at compile time rather than in production. For European businesses handling sensitive customer data and critical transactions, this level of reliability is not optional.\n\nOur TypeScript approach goes beyond basic type annotations. We define comprehensive type hierarchies for your domain models, API responses, and component props. Generic types and utility types keep our code DRY while maintaining full type safety. Discriminated unions model complex business logic clearly, making impossible states unrepresentable in your codebase.\n\nFor API integration, we generate TypeScript types directly from your backend schemas. Whether you use Supabase, a REST API with OpenAPI specs, or GraphQL with codegen, your frontend types stay in sync with your backend automatically. This eliminates the entire class of bugs caused by frontend-backend type mismatches.\n\nWe combine TypeScript with Zod for runtime validation at system boundaries. User input, API responses, and environment variables are validated at runtime with schemas that also serve as TypeScript types. This dual approach gives you compile-time safety within your codebase and runtime safety at its edges.\n\nOur TypeScript projects use path aliases, barrel exports, and strict module boundaries to keep large codebases navigable. ESLint with typescript-eslint enforces consistent patterns across your team. We configure strict compiler options including noUncheckedIndexedAccess and exactOptionalPropertyTypes for maximum safety.\n\nThe result is code that is easier to refactor, faster to onboard new developers to, and significantly less prone to production errors.

Our frontend team bridges the gap between visual design and production code, delivering interfaces that look exactly like the mockups while performing flawlessly under real-world conditions. We serve businesses across Europe who need their digital presence to reflect the quality of their brand.\n\nOur frontend stack is built on React and TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for styling. This combination gives us the component architecture of React, the type safety of TypeScript, and the utility-first flexibility of Tailwind. We use Radix UI primitives for accessible interactive components like dialogs, dropdowns, and tooltips, ensuring keyboard navigation and screen reader support are built in from the start.\n\nResponsive design is not an afterthought in our process. We design mobile-first and enhance progressively for larger screens. Every component is tested across breakpoints from 320px mobile to 2560px ultra-wide displays. We use CSS container queries alongside media queries for truly responsive components that adapt to their context, not just the viewport.\n\nAnimation and micro-interaction bring interfaces to life. We use Framer Motion for orchestrated animations including page transitions, scroll-triggered reveals, and interactive hover states. Performance is carefully managed with will-change hints, GPU-accelerated properties, and reduced motion preferences for accessibility.\n\nCross-browser compatibility is verified across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge on both desktop and mobile. We handle vendor prefixes, feature detection, and graceful degradation for older browsers when needed. Progressive enhancement ensures core functionality works everywhere while modern browsers get the full experience.\n\nEvery frontend project includes accessibility testing against WCAG 2.1 AA standards, Lighthouse performance audits targeting 95+ scores, and responsive testing across devices.

They load in the browser like a website but can be installed on the home screen, work offline, and send push notifications. For European businesses that need mobile reach without the cost and friction of app store development, PWAs are the smart choice.\n\nOur PWA development uses service workers to cache critical assets and enable offline functionality. Your users can browse products, read content, and even fill out forms without an internet connection. When connectivity returns, data syncs automatically. This is especially valuable for businesses with users in areas with unreliable connectivity or for field workers who need mobile access.\n\nThe installation experience is seamless. Users visiting your website on mobile see an install prompt that adds your app to their home screen in one tap. No app store required, no download wait, no storage warnings. Your PWA launches in full-screen mode with your brand colours and splash screen, indistinguishable from a native app.\n\nPush notifications re-engage users with timely, relevant messages. Order updates, appointment reminders, new content alerts, and promotional campaigns reach users directly on their devices. We implement notification preferences so users control what they receive, respecting both their preferences and GDPR requirements.\n\nPerformance is exceptional because PWAs load from local cache after the first visit. Subsequent page loads are near-instant, and navigation feels native with smooth transitions and responsive touch interactions. We optimise asset caching strategies to balance freshness with speed, ensuring users always see current content without sacrificing performance.\n\nOur PWA stack includes Workbox for service worker management, the Web Push API for notifications, and the Cache API for intelligent asset caching.

We extend Supabase with Edge Functions for custom business logic, webhook handlers, and third-party integrations that run close to your users across Europe.\n\nFor projects requiring custom API architecture, we build with Node.js and Express or Hono frameworks. RESTful API design follows industry best practices with proper HTTP methods, status codes, pagination, filtering, and error responses. We implement rate limiting, request validation with Zod, and comprehensive error handling so your API is robust in production.\n\nAuthentication and authorisation are critical.

Slow page loads, security vulnerabilities, limited mobile experience, and mounting maintenance costs are symptoms of an outdated tech stack. Our legacy modernisation service moves your website from old technology to a modern, maintainable, and performant architecture without disrupting your business.\n\nWe have migrated websites from WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, custom PHP, jQuery-based sites, and Angular 1.x applications to modern React and Next.js architectures. Each migration follows a proven methodology that preserves your SEO rankings, maintains URL structures, and ensures zero downtime during the transition.\n\nThe modernisation process starts with a thorough audit of your existing system. We document every page, URL, redirect, form, integration, and piece of custom functionality. This creates a complete migration checklist that ensures nothing is lost in translation. We identify which features should be rebuilt, which can be simplified, and which are no longer needed.\n\nOur migration approach is incremental when possible. Using the strangler fig pattern, we can replace sections of your old site one at a time while both systems run in parallel. This reduces risk and allows you to see improvements immediately rather than waiting for a complete rebuild. Critical features like contact forms and e-commerce functionality are migrated first.\n\nSEO preservation is a primary concern throughout the migration. We create comprehensive redirect maps, migrate all metadata, preserve internal linking structures, and submit updated sitemaps to Google. We monitor Search Console throughout the migration to catch and fix any indexation issues quickly. Our clients typically see SEO improvements after migration due to better performance and cleaner markup.\n\nThe end result is a modern, fast, secure website that costs less to maintain and is easier to extend with new features. You get full source code ownership, comprehensive documentation, and a development environment that makes future changes straightforward.

Payload CMS is our top recommendation because it is built with TypeScript, self-hosted for full data control, and infinitely customisable. For European businesses concerned about data sovereignty, self-hosting means your content data stays within the EU.\n\nThe content modelling phase is critical. We design your content types, fields, and relationships to match how your team thinks about content. Blog posts, case studies, team members, services, FAQ sections — each content type gets a tailored editing experience with validation, preview, and publishing workflows. Rich text editors support embedding images, videos, and custom components.\n\nOn the frontend, content is fetched via API and rendered with React or Next.js. Static generation means content changes are reflected on your website within seconds of publishing while serving pre-built HTML for maximum performance. We implement preview modes so editors can see exactly how content will look before publishing.\n\nMultilingual content management is built into every headless CMS setup. Editors can manage content in English, French, Dutch, and German from a single interface with proper locale fallbacks and translation workflows. The frontend automatically routes users to the correct language based on URL structure and browser preferences.\n\nAccess control ensures the right people can edit the right content.

We measure Core Web Vitals including Largest Contentful Paint, First Input Delay, Cumulative Layout Shift, and Interaction to Next Paint. Each metric is benchmarked against your competitors and industry standards so you know exactly where you stand.\n\nImage optimisation often delivers the biggest wins. We implement next-gen formats like WebP and AVIF with automatic fallbacks, responsive images with srcset for different screen sizes, lazy loading for below-the-fold content, and proper width and height attributes to prevent layout shifts. For hero images and LCP elements, we use priority loading to ensure they appear instantly.\n\nJavaScript is the second biggest performance bottleneck. We implement code splitting to break your bundle into smaller chunks loaded on demand. Tree shaking eliminates unused code. Dynamic imports defer heavy libraries until they are needed. We audit third-party scripts and remove or defer those that block rendering. Bundle analysis identifies the largest dependencies and finds lighter alternatives.\n\nServer-side optimisation includes proper cache headers, CDN configuration, Brotli compression, and edge computing for dynamic content.

Beyond compliance, accessible websites reach a wider audience, perform better in search results, and provide a better experience for all users, not just those with disabilities.\n\nOur accessibility service starts with a thorough audit against WCAG 2.1 AA standards. We test with automated tools like axe-core and Lighthouse, but the real value comes from manual testing. We navigate your entire site using only a keyboard, test with screen readers including NVDA and VoiceOver, check colour contrast ratios, verify focus management, and assess content structure.\n\nThe audit produces a prioritised remediation plan. Critical issues that prevent access to core functionality are fixed first. These include missing alt text on images, form inputs without labels, keyboard traps, and missing focus indicators. We then address medium-priority issues like heading hierarchy, link text, ARIA usage, and touch target sizes.\n\nOur remediation work is thorough. We implement proper semantic HTML structure with landmarks, headings, and ARIA attributes. Interactive components like modals, accordions, and menus receive full keyboard support with proper focus trapping and escape key handling. Forms get associated labels, error messages connected with aria-describedby, and live regions for dynamic feedback.\n\nColour and visual accessibility is addressed by ensuring all text meets minimum contrast ratios, providing focus indicators that are visible against all backgrounds, and supporting reduced-motion preferences for users who are sensitive to animation. We never rely solely on colour to convey information.\n\nPost-remediation, we provide your team with an accessibility statement for your website, documentation of accessible patterns used, and training on maintaining accessibility as you add new content and features. We can also set up automated accessibility testing in your CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions before they reach production.",

Your website needs to talk to your CRM, your payment processor needs to update your accounting software, and your marketing platform needs data from your contact forms. We build reliable integrations that connect your website with the tools your business depends on.\n\nOur integration approach starts with mapping your tool ecosystem. We identify every system that needs to exchange data with your website, document the data flows between them, and design the integration architecture. Whether it is a simple webhook, a scheduled sync, or a real-time bidirectional connection, we choose the right pattern for each integration.\n\nCRM integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, and Zoho are among our most common projects. Form submissions on your website create leads in your CRM automatically. Lead scoring, assignment rules, and notification workflows can be triggered based on website behaviour. We also build reverse integrations where CRM data enriches the website experience, such as showing personalised content to returning leads.\n\nPayment integrations go beyond basic Stripe checkout. We build subscription management, invoicing automation, multi-currency support, and EU tax calculation. Payment events trigger downstream actions like sending confirmation emails, updating inventory, creating invoices in your accounting software, and enrolling customers in onboarding sequences.\n\nMarketing tool integrations include Mailchimp, SendGrid, ActiveCampaign, and custom email systems. We connect newsletter signups, lead magnets, and purchase events to your email marketing platform with proper segmentation. Event tracking from your website feeds into marketing automation workflows for targeted, behaviour-based campaigns.\n\nEvery integration is built with error handling, retry logic, and monitoring. We implement webhook signature verification for security, idempotency keys for reliability, and structured logging for debugging. Integration health dashboards show you the status of every connection in real time. When something goes wrong, alerts fire immediately and fallback mechanisms prevent data loss.",

Unlike off-the-shelf themes that look like every other store, our custom themes reflect your brand identity with unique layouts, animations, and interactive elements. Product pages are designed for your specific product types, whether you sell fashion, electronics, food, or services.\n\nShopify Markets makes selling internationally straightforward. We configure multi-currency pricing with automatic exchange rate updates, localised checkout experiences in English, French, Dutch, and German, and region-specific shipping rates and tax calculations. Customers in France see prices in euros, customers in the UK see pounds, and everyone gets a checkout experience in their own language.\n\nApp integrations extend your store's capabilities. We integrate review platforms like Trustpilot and Yotpo, email marketing with Klaviyo, inventory management with TradeGecko or Stocky, and accounting with Xero or QuickBooks. Each integration is tested thoroughly and documented so your team understands the data flows.\n\nShopify SEO is optimised from the start.

We implement strategic pricing for each market rather than just converting from a base currency. A product priced at EUR 49.99 might be GBP 44.99 in the UK and CHF 52.90 in Switzerland — prices that feel natural in each market rather than awkward converted amounts. You control pricing per market while automatic conversion handles the rest.\n\nPayment methods vary significantly across European markets. Dutch customers expect iDEAL, Belgian customers use Bancontact, German customers prefer Giropay or SOFORT, and French customers often use Carte Bancaire. We integrate all relevant local payment methods alongside Stripe for card payments, ensuring every customer can pay their preferred way.\n\nTax calculation is handled automatically based on customer location. EU VAT rates, UK VAT, Swiss VAT, and exemptions for B2B transactions with valid VAT numbers are all managed in real time. Tax is displayed correctly in the customer's currency, and invoices are generated with the proper tax details for each jurisdiction.\n\nShipping and logistics configuration supports cross-border commerce. We set up shipping zones, carrier integrations, customs declaration automation, and delivery estimate calculations. Customers see accurate shipping costs and delivery times based on their location before checkout.\n\nThe entire multi-currency experience is tied to our multilingual infrastructure.

Our technical SEO service identifies and fixes every technical barrier preventing your website from achieving its full search potential in European markets.\n\nOur technical audits go deeper than automated tools. While we use Screaming Frog, Sitebulb, and Google Search Console for data collection, the real value is in expert analysis. We examine your site architecture, internal linking patterns, URL structures, and crawl budget allocation. For large websites, understanding how Google discovers and prioritises your pages is critical to improving rankings.\n\nCore Web Vitals are now a confirmed ranking factor. We measure and optimise Largest Contentful Paint, Interaction to Next Paint, and Cumulative Layout Shift across your entire site. This involves performance optimisation work including image compression, code splitting, font loading strategies, and render-blocking resource elimination. We target passing scores on both mobile and desktop.\n\nCrawlability and indexation determine which pages Google can find and include in search results. We audit your robots.txt, XML sitemaps, canonical tags, and internal linking to ensure search engines can efficiently crawl your important pages. Orphaned pages, redirect chains, and crawl traps are identified and resolved.\n\nStructured data implementation helps search engines understand your content and display rich results. We implement relevant schema types including Organization, LocalBusiness, Product, FAQ, HowTo, BreadcrumbList, and Article markup. Each schema is tested with Google's Rich Results Test and monitored for errors in Search Console.\n\nFor multilingual European websites, technical SEO includes proper hreflang implementation, international targeting in Search Console, locale-specific sitemaps, and cross-domain verification for country-specific domains.

We create or claim your profile, complete every field with optimised content, select the right categories, add professional photos, and set up messaging and booking links. Regular posts keep your profile active and give Google fresh signals about your business. We monitor and respond to reviews promptly, building the social proof that influences local search rankings.\n\nLocal citation building ensures your business name, address, and phone number are consistent across the web.

A web agency in Paris, web development London, webbureau Amsterdam — each page provides genuine local content, not just templated city names swapped in. Client testimonials, local project case studies, and area-specific information make these pages valuable to both users and search engines.\n\nLocal schema markup connects your website to your Google Business Profile. We implement LocalBusiness schema with address, geo-coordinates, opening hours, service areas, and department information. This structured data helps search engines confidently display your business in local results and knowledge panels.\n\nReview management is integrated into your local SEO strategy.

We analyse search volume, competition, intent, and business relevance to build a prioritised keyword map. For European businesses, this means researching in each target language separately because keyword opportunities vary significantly between markets. A high-volume term in French may have a completely different landscape in German.\n\nTopic clustering organises your content into authoritative topic hubs. Instead of writing isolated articles, we create pillar pages for broad topics and cluster content for specific subtopics, all interlinked strategically. This structure signals to Google that your website has comprehensive expertise on each subject, improving rankings for the entire cluster.\n\nEditorial calendars translate strategy into action. We plan three to six months of content at a time, mapping each piece to target keywords, buyer journey stages, and seasonal opportunities. Content types include blog articles, landing pages, case studies, guides, and glossary entries. Each piece has a defined purpose in your content funnel.\n\nContent creation follows SEO best practices while maintaining readability and authority.

We audit your website's technical health, content effectiveness, backlink profile, and competitive positioning. This assessment establishes your baseline and identifies the highest-impact opportunities. The resulting roadmap prioritises actions by expected impact and effort, giving your team a clear plan to follow.\n\nStrategy sessions are conducted monthly or bi-weekly depending on your needs. We review progress against the roadmap, analyse ranking and traffic changes, and adjust strategy based on what the data shows. These sessions cover keyword strategy, content priorities, technical issues, and competitive intelligence. Your team leaves each session with clear, actionable tasks for the next period.\n\nTeam training builds internal SEO capabilities. We conduct workshops on technical SEO fundamentals, content optimisation, keyword research methodology, and analytics interpretation. Training is customised to your team's skill level and focused on the specific types of content and pages they manage.

Our analytics setup service implements Google Analytics 4 with the depth and accuracy that European businesses need for compliant, insightful reporting.\n\nGA4 configuration goes far beyond adding a tracking script. We set up your property with proper data streams, configure cross-domain tracking if needed, and implement enhanced measurement for scroll depth, outbound clicks, video engagement, and file downloads. Custom dimensions and metrics capture business-specific data that standard events do not cover.\n\nGoogle Consent Mode v2 is mandatory for European websites using Google Analytics. We implement consent integration with your cookie management platform so GA4 respects user choices. When users decline analytics cookies, GA4 runs in cookieless mode with modelled conversions. When they consent, full tracking activates. This ensures GDPR compliance while maintaining useful data.\n\nCustom event tracking captures the specific user actions that matter to your business. Form submissions, CTA clicks, phone number clicks, pricing page views, demo bookings, file downloads, and video plays are all tracked as named events with relevant parameters. These events feed into conversion goals and audience segments.\n\nConversion tracking connects your analytics to business outcomes. We set up conversion events for your key objectives whether they are contact form submissions, purchases, phone calls, or booking confirmations. Google Ads conversion import links your paid campaigns directly to these outcomes for accurate ROI measurement.\n\nReporting dashboards transform raw data into actionable insights. We build custom Looker Studio dashboards that show traffic sources, user behaviour, conversion performance, and campaign results in a clear, visual format. Dashboards are shared with your team and stakeholders, with automated email delivery on your preferred schedule.\n\nData quality assurance ensures your analytics are accurate from day one. We test every event, verify conversion tracking, check referral exclusions, filter internal traffic, and validate cross-domain tracking. A data quality audit document confirms everything is working correctly before we hand over.",

      "longDesc": "Great design is invisible. Users do not notice good UX because everything works as expected. They notice bad UX immediately. Our UX/UI design service creates digital experiences where users accomplish their goals effortlessly, resulting in higher conversion rates, longer engagement, and stronger brand perception for your European business.\n\nUser research grounds every design decision in evidence. We conduct stakeholder interviews to understand business goals, user interviews to understand customer needs, and competitive analysis to identify industry benchmarks. For European projects, we research cross-cultural differences in design expectations. German users expect different information density than French users. British users have different trust signals than Dutch users.\n\nInformation architecture defines how content is organised and navigated. We create sitemaps and user flow diagrams that map every path through your digital product. Card sorting exercises with real users validate our navigation structure. The goal is a structure where users find what they need in three clicks or fewer.\n\nWireframing translates architecture into layout. Low-fidelity wireframes establish content hierarchy, component placement, and interaction patterns without the distraction of visual design. We wireframe for mobile, tablet, and desktop simultaneously, ensuring responsive design is considered from the start, not bolted on later.\n\nVisual design brings wireframes to life with your brand identity. We design pixel-perfect interfaces in Figma with consistent spacing, typography, colour usage, and component patterns. Design systems ensure every element follows the same rules, making the interface feel cohesive and professional. Dark themes, light themes, and accessibility modes are designed as needed.\n\nPrototyping lets you experience the design before development begins. Interactive Figma prototypes simulate real user flows including page transitions, form interactions, and state changes. Usability testing with prototypes reveals issues that static mockups miss. We iterate until the design is validated by real user feedback.\n\nDesign handoff to developers is comprehensive. Every component is documented with specifications for spacing, colours, typography, states, and responsive behaviour. Developers receive organised Figma files with proper naming conventions, auto-layout, and component variants that map directly to code implementation.",

Our digital strategy consulting connects your business objectives to specific digital initiatives, channels, and metrics, creating a clear roadmap for sustainable online growth.\n\nMarket analysis establishes the landscape. We research your industry's digital maturity, identify how customers find and evaluate providers like you, and map the competitive landscape across your target European markets. This analysis reveals which channels drive the most value, where competitors are vulnerable, and what opportunities are underexploited.\n\nCompetitor research goes deep. We analyse competitors' websites, content strategies, SEO performance, paid advertising, social media presence, and conversion tactics. This is not about copying what they do. It is about understanding what works in your market so we can differentiate your approach and find gaps they have missed.\n\nChannel strategy defines where to invest your digital budget and effort. We evaluate the potential of organic search, paid search, social media, email marketing, content marketing, and partnerships based on your specific business, audience, and goals. Each recommended channel includes expected ROI, resource requirements, and timeline to results.\n\nRoadmap creation translates strategy into quarterly action plans. Each quarter has defined initiatives, responsible teams, budget allocations, and success metrics. The roadmap is realistic about resources and prioritises high-impact activities that build on each other. Quick wins are identified for early momentum alongside longer-term investments.\n\nKPI framework ensures progress is measurable. We define leading indicators that predict success and lagging indicators that confirm it. Monthly scorecard reviews track progress against targets, and quarterly strategy reviews adjust the plan based on what the data shows. This disciplined approach ensures your digital investment delivers measurable business outcomes.\n\nFor European businesses operating across multiple markets, digital strategy addresses market prioritisation, resource allocation between countries, and coordination of multi-market campaigns.

A strong brand identity creates instant recognition, builds trust, and positions your business as professional and credible. Our brand identity service creates cohesive visual systems that work across digital and print touchpoints for European businesses.\n\nBrand strategy precedes design. Before sketching logos, we define your brand positioning, personality, and values. Who are your customers? What makes you different from competitors? What feeling should your brand evoke? These strategic decisions guide every design choice and ensure your visual identity supports your business objectives.\n\nLogo design is the centrepiece of brand identity. We develop multiple logo concepts exploring different directions, then refine the chosen concept through iterative feedback. Each logo works in full colour, single colour, reversed, and small formats. We create primary, secondary, and icon versions to ensure flexibility across all applications.\n\nColour palette selection is systematic. We choose a primary colour that reflects your brand personality, supporting colours for hierarchy and variety, and neutral tones for text and backgrounds. Each colour is specified in HEX, RGB, CMYK, and Pantone values for consistency across digital and print. Accessibility testing ensures sufficient contrast for all text combinations.\n\nTypography pairs are selected for both impact and readability. We recommend display and body font combinations from premium foundries, Google Fonts, or open-source libraries. Font scales define sizes for headings, body text, captions, and UI elements across devices. Weight and style usage rules prevent the visual chaos that undermines many brand identities.\n\nBrand guidelines document everything in a comprehensive, usable format. Logo usage rules with clear space, minimum sizes, and prohibited modifications. Colour specifications with primary, secondary, and accent palettes. Typography scales and pairing rules.

      "longDesc": "A design system is the single source of truth for how your digital products look, feel, and behave. It eliminates inconsistency, reduces development time, and ensures every new feature or page automatically aligns with your established patterns. For growing European businesses building multiple digital products, a design system is an investment that pays for itself quickly.\n\nDesign tokens are the atomic building blocks. We define colours, spacing, typography, shadows, border radii, and breakpoints as tokens that flow from design tools to code. When you decide to adjust your primary colour or increase base spacing, the change propagates everywhere automatically. Tokens are documented in a format that both designers and developers understand.\n\nComponent libraries bring tokens together into reusable UI elements. Buttons, inputs, cards, modals, navigation, tables, and dozens more components are designed with every state and variant accounted for. Each component handles hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, and error states. Responsive behaviour and accessibility are built into every component from the start.\n\nIn Figma, components use auto-layout, variants, and component properties so designers can build pages by assembling components rather than drawing from scratch. Consistent naming conventions match between Figma and code, making design-to-development handoff seamless. Designers drag in a Button component and developers use the matching Button React component.\n\nIn code, the design system is implemented as a React component library with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI primitives. Each component is fully typed with proper props interfaces, supports theming through CSS custom properties, and includes comprehensive accessibility features. Storybook documents every component with interactive examples and usage guidelines.\n\nGovernance ensures the design system stays healthy as it grows. We establish contribution guidelines, review processes, and versioning strategies. New components follow a proposal, design, build, and release workflow. Breaking changes are communicated clearly with migration guides. The design system serves your team, not the other way around.",

Instead of spending months building a product that might miss the mark, a prototype lets you test core concepts with real users in days. Our rapid prototyping service turns your ideas into interactive demos that look and feel like real products.\n\nWe prototype at different fidelity levels depending on what you need to validate. Low-fidelity wireframe prototypes test information architecture and user flows. They answer questions like: can users find what they need? Does the navigation make sense? Is the page structure logical? These prototypes are built in hours and tested the same day.\n\nMedium-fidelity prototypes add visual design and interactive elements. They test the look and feel alongside the functionality. Users can click through realistic screens, fill out forms, and experience transitions. These prototypes answer: does the design communicate the right message? Are interactive elements intuitive? Does the visual hierarchy guide attention correctly?\n\nHigh-fidelity prototypes are nearly indistinguishable from real products. Built in Figma with smart animate transitions and realistic data, or coded with React and mock data, these prototypes can be used for investor demos, stakeholder presentations, and detailed usability testing. They answer: would users actually use this product? What needs to change before development?\n\nUsability testing with prototypes reveals issues that no amount of internal review can catch. We recruit participants matching your target audience, write test scripts, facilitate sessions, and analyse results. Testing can be conducted in English, French, Dutch, or German depending on your target market. Five users typically reveal 85% of usability issues.\n\nPrototype insights directly inform the development specification. Instead of building from a static design, your development team builds from a tested, validated prototype. This dramatically reduces the number of changes needed during and after development. The prototype also serves as a reference point for design QA, ensuring the final product matches the validated experience.",

      "pwa3A": "Yes. Users can add your PWA to their home screen with one tap. It launches in full-screen mode with your brand icon and splash screen, looking identical to a native app. No app store required.",
      "pwa4Q": "Does a PWA work offline?",
      "pwa4A": "Yes. Service workers cache critical assets and content for offline access. Users can browse cached content, fill out forms, and interact with the app without internet. Data syncs when connectivity returns.",
      "apiDev1Q": "What API architecture do you recommend?",
      "apiDev1A": "For most projects, we recommend Supabase auto-generated REST APIs extended with Edge Functions for custom logic. For complex requirements, we build custom APIs with Node.js following RESTful design principles.",
      "apiDev2Q": "How do you secure APIs?",
      "apiDev2A": "APIs are secured with JWT authentication, refresh token rotation, rate limiting, request validation with Zod, and row-level security in the database. We follow OWASP API security best practices.",
      "apiDev3Q": "Do you provide API documentation?",
      "apiDev3A": "Every API comes with auto-generated OpenAPI documentation including endpoint descriptions, request and response schemas, authentication guides, and interactive testing through Swagger UI.",
      "apiDev4Q": "Can you build a GraphQL API?",
      "apiDev4A": "Yes. Supabase provides auto-generated GraphQL APIs. For custom GraphQL needs, we build with Apollo Server or Pothos. GraphQL is ideal for frontend applications that need flexible data fetching.",
      "legacyMod1Q": "Which legacy platforms can you migrate from?",
      "legacyMod1A": "We migrate from WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, custom PHP, jQuery-based sites, Angular 1.x, and other outdated platforms to modern React and Next.js architectures with full SEO preservation.",
      "legacyMod2Q": "Will we have downtime during the migration?",
      "legacyMod2A": "No. We use an incremental migration approach where old and new systems run in parallel. The cutover happens instantly with DNS changes, and we can roll back within minutes if any issues arise.",
      "legacyMod3Q": "How do you preserve our SEO during migration?",
      "legacyMod3A": "We create comprehensive redirect maps for every URL, migrate all metadata and structured data, and monitor Google Search Console throughout the process. Most clients see SEO improvements after migration.",
      "legacyMod4Q": "What cost savings can we expect after modernisation?",
      "legacyMod4A": "Clients typically see 40 to 60 percent reduction in maintenance costs within the first year. Modern codebases require fewer patches, have better developer tooling, and new features ship faster.",
      "headlessCms1Q": "What is a headless CMS and why should I use one?",
      "headlessCms1A": "A headless CMS separates content management from the website frontend. Your team edits content in a familiar interface while the website runs on modern, fast technology. You get both editorial flexibility and top performance.",
      "headlessCms2Q": "Which headless CMS do you recommend?",
      "headlessCms2A": "Payload CMS is our top recommendation. It is TypeScript-based, self-hosted for EU data sovereignty, and infinitely customisable. We also work with Strapi and Sanity depending on project requirements.",
      "headlessCms3Q": "Can editors preview content before publishing?",
      "headlessCms3A": "Yes. We implement live preview functionality so editors see exactly how their content will appear on the website before clicking publish. Changes are visible in real time as they edit.",
      "headlessCms4Q": "Does a headless CMS support multiple languages?",
      "headlessCms4A": "Absolutely. Multilingual content management is built into every headless CMS setup. Editors manage content in all languages from a single interface with proper locale fallbacks and translation workflows.",
      "perfOpt1Q": "What Lighthouse score improvement can I expect?",
      "perfOpt1A": "We guarantee 95+ Lighthouse scores after optimisation. Websites starting at 30 to 50 typically reach 95 or above. The exact improvement depends on your starting point and technology stack.",
      "perfOpt2Q": "How long does performance optimisation take?",
      "perfOpt2A": "A typical optimisation project takes two to four weeks. We start with the highest-impact changes like image optimisation and code splitting, delivering measurable improvements within the first week.",
      "perfOpt3Q": "Will performance optimisation affect our website's functionality?",
      "perfOpt3A": "No. All optimisations are tested to ensure functionality remains identical. We focus on how assets are loaded and delivered, not on changing what your website does.",
      "perfOpt4Q": "Do you optimise for mobile performance specifically?",
      "perfOpt4A": "Yes. Mobile performance receives special attention since Google uses mobile-first indexing. We test on real mobile devices and 4G network conditions to ensure fast loading for all users.",
      "a11y1Q": "Is web accessibility legally required in Europe?",
      "a11y1A": "Yes. The European Accessibility Act requires digital services to be accessible by June 2025. Non-compliance can result in fines and legal action. Our audits ensure your website meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.",
      "a11y2Q": "What does WCAG 2.1 AA compliance involve?",
      "a11y2A": "WCAG 2.1 AA covers perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust content. This includes text alternatives for images, keyboard navigation, colour contrast, form labels, and screen reader compatibility.",
      "a11y3Q": "How do you test for accessibility?",
      "a11y3A": "We combine automated testing with axe-core and Lighthouse with manual testing using keyboard navigation, screen readers like NVDA and VoiceOver, and colour contrast analysis across all pages.",
      "a11y4Q": "Can you make an existing website accessible?",
      "a11y4A": "Yes. We audit existing websites, create a prioritised remediation plan, and implement fixes. Most accessibility improvements can be made without redesigning the website, just improving the underlying code.",
      "integrations1Q": "Which CRM platforms do you integrate with?",
      "integrations1A": "We integrate with Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, and Monday.com. Form submissions, lead scoring, and website behaviour data flow automatically into your CRM for efficient follow-up.",
      "integrations2Q": "How reliable are your integrations?",
      "integrations2A": "Every integration includes error handling, retry logic, and monitoring. Webhook signatures are verified for security, and idempotency keys prevent duplicate processing. Health dashboards show real-time status.",
      "integrations3Q": "Can you connect our website to accounting software?",
      "integrations3A": "Yes. We integrate with Xero, QuickBooks, and other accounting platforms. Payment events, invoices, and subscription data can flow automatically to your accounting system, reducing manual data entry.",
      "integrations4Q": "How long does an integration project take?",
      "integrations4A": "Simple integrations like CRM form submission take one to two weeks. Complex multi-system integrations with bidirectional sync take four to eight weeks depending on the systems involved.",
      "shopifyDev1Q": "Why choose Shopify over custom e-commerce?",
      "shopifyDev1A": "Shopify handles hosting, security, PCI compliance, and payment processing out of the box. For most retail businesses, this reduces costs and launch time significantly compared to custom builds.",
      "shopifyDev2Q": "Can you create a custom Shopify theme?",
      "shopifyDev2A": "Yes. We build custom Shopify themes from scratch using Liquid, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your store gets a unique design that reflects your brand rather than looking like every other Shopify store.",
      "shopifyDev3Q": "Does Shopify support multi-currency for European selling?",
      "shopifyDev3A": "Yes. Shopify Markets handles multi-currency pricing, localised checkout, and regional payment methods. We configure EUR, GBP, and CHF with market-specific pricing strategies for each country.",
      "shopifyDev4Q": "Can you migrate our store to Shopify?",
      "shopifyDev4A": "Yes. We migrate from WooCommerce, Magento, PrestaShop, and other platforms to Shopify. Products, customers, orders, and SEO data are transferred with proper redirects to preserve search rankings.",
      "multiCurrency1Q": "How do you handle currency conversion?",
      "multiCurrency1A": "We implement strategic per-market pricing rather than simple conversion. You set prices that feel natural in each currency. Automatic conversion with live exchange rates is available for products without manual pricing.",
      "multiCurrency2Q": "Which currencies do you support?",
      "multiCurrency2A": "We support EUR, GBP, CHF, and any other currency your markets require. Each currency gets its own pricing strategy, rounding rules, and tax configuration.",
      "multiCurrency3Q": "How is tax handled across different countries?",
      "multiCurrency3A": "VAT is calculated automatically based on customer location. EU VAT rates, UK VAT, Swiss VAT, and B2B reverse charge mechanisms are all handled. Tax details appear correctly on invoices per jurisdiction.",
      "multiCurrency4Q": "Can customers choose their preferred currency?",
      "multiCurrency4A": "Yes. Geo-detection sets the default currency based on location, but customers can manually switch. Their preference is saved for future visits across devices.",
      "technicalSeo1Q": "What does a technical SEO audit cover?",
      "technicalSeo1A": "Our audit covers site speed, Core Web Vitals, crawlability, indexation, structured data, internal linking, mobile usability, and security. We produce a prioritised action plan with estimated impact for each fix.",
      "technicalSeo2Q": "How do Core Web Vitals affect rankings?",
      "technicalSeo2A": "Core Web Vitals are a confirmed Google ranking factor. Pages that pass LCP, INP, and CLS thresholds receive a ranking boost. Failing pages may be penalised, especially on mobile where competition is tight.",
      "technicalSeo3Q": "Can you fix our structured data errors?",
      "technicalSeo3A": "Yes. We audit and fix all structured data issues including missing schema markup, validation errors, and warnings. We implement Organization, LocalBusiness, Product, FAQ, and BreadcrumbList schemas as relevant.",
      "technicalSeo4Q": "How often should technical SEO be audited?",
      "technicalSeo4A": "We recommend quarterly technical audits to catch new issues from content changes, plugin updates, and algorithm changes. Monthly monitoring of Search Console catches critical issues between full audits.",
      "localSeo1Q": "How important is Google Business Profile for local SEO?",
      "localSeo1A": "Google Business Profile is the single most important factor for local search rankings. A fully optimised profile with reviews, photos, and regular posts significantly increases your visibility in local results and Google Maps.",
      "localSeo2Q": "How long does local SEO take to show results?",
      "localSeo2A": "Google Business Profile improvements can show impact within two to four weeks. Local citation building and content creation typically take two to three months to noticeably improve local rankings.",
      "localSeo3Q": "Do you handle review management?",
      "localSeo3A": "Yes. We set up review request automation, monitor new reviews across platforms, and provide response templates. A steady flow of genuine positive reviews improves both rankings and customer trust.",
      "localSeo4Q": "Can you do local SEO for multiple cities?",
      "localSeo4A": "Yes. We create geo-targeted landing pages for each city you serve with unique local content, not just templated pages. Each city page targets local keywords and references relevant local projects and clients.",
      "contentSeo1Q": "How many articles should we publish per month?",
      "contentSeo1A": "Quality matters more than quantity. We recommend two to four well-researched, long-form articles per month for most businesses. Consistency over months compounds into significant organic traffic growth.",
      "contentSeo2Q": "Do you write the content or do we?",
      "contentSeo2A": "Both options are available. We can write content directly or create detailed content briefs for your team or writers. Briefs include target keywords, outline, word count, internal links, and metadata guidelines.",
      "contentSeo3Q": "What is topic clustering and why does it matter?",
      "contentSeo3A": "Topic clustering groups related content around a central pillar page. This signals topical authority to Google and improves rankings for the entire cluster. It is more effective than publishing isolated articles.",
      "contentSeo4Q": "How do you measure content performance?",
      "contentSeo4A": "We track rankings for target keywords, organic traffic per article, time on page, and conversions attributed to content. Underperforming content is refreshed and re-optimised in our continuous improvement cycle.",
      "linkBuilding1Q": "What makes a backlink high quality?",
      "linkBuilding1A": "Relevant website in your industry, strong domain authority, editorial context around the link, and natural anchor text. One quality backlink from a respected publication outperforms hundreds of directory links.",
      "linkBuilding2Q": "Do you buy links?",
      "linkBuilding2A": "No. We only use white-hat link building methods including digital PR, guest posting, and broken link outreach. Buying links violates Google guidelines and risks penalisation that can destroy your rankings.",
      "linkBuilding3Q": "How many links can you build per month?",
      "linkBuilding3A": "Quality link building typically yields 5 to 15 new referring domains per month depending on your industry. We focus on relevance and authority rather than volume. Each link is earned through genuine value.",
      "linkBuilding4Q": "How long until link building affects rankings?",
      "linkBuilding4A": "New links typically take four to eight weeks to influence rankings. The full impact of a link building campaign becomes clear over three to six months as domain authority grows cumulatively.",
      "seoConsulting1Q": "How is SEO consulting different from SEO services?",
      "seoConsulting1A": "SEO services mean we do the work. SEO consulting means we guide your team. You get strategic direction, training, and expert review while your internal team handles execution. It is more cost-effective for teams with capacity.",
      "seoConsulting2Q": "How often do consulting sessions happen?",
      "seoConsulting2A": "Monthly or bi-weekly depending on your needs and pace of implementation. Each session reviews progress, analyses data, adjusts strategy, and sets priorities for the next period.",
      "seoConsulting3Q": "Can you train our marketing team on SEO?",
      "seoConsulting3A": "Yes. We conduct customised workshops on technical SEO, content optimisation, keyword research, and analytics. Training is tailored to your team's skill level and the specific tools they use.",
      "seoConsulting4Q": "What deliverables do we get from consulting?",
      "seoConsulting4A": "An initial SEO roadmap, monthly strategy session notes with task lists, quarterly performance reviews, content feedback on demand, and team training materials. All documented and actionable.",
      "googleAds1Q": "What is a reasonable Google Ads budget for European markets?",
      "googleAds1A": "We recommend a minimum of EUR 500 per month per market. This provides enough data for meaningful optimisation. Our management fee starts at EUR 247 per month on top of ad spend.",
      "googleAds2Q": "How quickly will Google Ads generate leads?",
      "googleAds2A": "Ads can generate traffic from day one. However, the first two weeks are an optimisation period where we refine targeting, bids, and ad copy. Meaningful lead volume typically stabilises within four to six weeks.",
      "googleAds3Q": "Do you manage ads in multiple languages?",
      "googleAds3A": "Yes. We create separate campaigns for each language and market with localised keyword research, ad copy, and landing pages. Each market is optimised independently based on its performance data.",
      "googleAds4Q": "How do you measure Google Ads ROI?",
      "googleAds4A": "We set up conversion tracking from day one measuring leads, sales, and phone calls. Monthly reports show cost per acquisition, return on ad spend, and which campaigns deliver the best results.",
      "analyticsSetup1Q": "Why should I switch to Google Analytics 4?",
      "analyticsSetup1A": "Universal Analytics stopped processing data in 2024. GA4 is now the only supported version. It offers event-based tracking, cross-platform measurement, and machine learning insights that UA could not provide.",
      "analyticsSetup2Q": "What is Consent Mode v2 and is it mandatory?",
      "analyticsSetup2A": "Consent Mode v2 communicates user consent to Google services. It is mandatory for EU websites using Google Analytics or Ads since March 2024. Without it, you risk data collection violations and inaccurate reporting.",
      "analyticsSetup3Q": "Can you set up custom event tracking?",
      "analyticsSetup3A": "Yes. We track any user action including form submissions, button clicks, scroll depth, video plays, file downloads, and custom business events. Each event is named and parameterised for clear reporting.",
      "analyticsSetup4Q": "Do you create reporting dashboards?",
      "analyticsSetup4A": "Yes. We build custom Looker Studio dashboards showing traffic, behaviour, and conversion data. Dashboards are shared with your team and can be emailed automatically on a weekly or monthly schedule.",
      "uxUiDesign1Q": "What is the difference between UX and UI design?",
      "uxUiDesign1A": "UX design focuses on how a product works: user flows, information architecture, and interaction patterns. UI design focuses on how it looks: colours, typography, and visual style. Both are essential for effective digital products.",
      "uxUiDesign2Q": "Do you conduct user research?",
      "uxUiDesign2A": "Yes. We conduct stakeholder interviews, user interviews, competitive analysis, and usability testing. For European projects, we research cross-cultural design expectations for each target market.",
      "uxUiDesign3Q": "Which design tools do you use?",
      "uxUiDesign3A": "Figma is our primary design tool. We create wireframes, visual designs, interactive prototypes, and design system components all within Figma for seamless collaboration and developer handoff.",
      "uxUiDesign4Q": "How many design revisions are included?",
      "uxUiDesign4A": "We include three rounds of revisions in every project. Most designs are finalised within two rounds. Our iterative process with wireframes and prototypes reduces major revisions by validating concepts early.",
      "digitalStrategy1Q": "What does a digital strategy include?",
      "digitalStrategy1A": "Market analysis, competitor research, channel evaluation, quarterly roadmap with initiatives and budgets, KPI framework, and ongoing review sessions. It answers how your business should grow online.",
      "digitalStrategy2Q": "How long does developing a digital strategy take?",
      "digitalStrategy2A": "Initial strategy development takes three to four weeks including research, analysis, and roadmap creation. Ongoing consulting with quarterly reviews ensures the strategy adapts to market changes and results.",
      "digitalStrategy3Q": "Is digital strategy worth it for small businesses?",
      "digitalStrategy3A": "Especially for small businesses. Limited budgets make strategic allocation critical. A clear strategy prevents wasting money on ineffective channels and focuses resources where they deliver the most return.",
      "digitalStrategy4Q": "Do you help implement the strategy or just plan it?",
      "digitalStrategy4A": "Both. We develop the strategy and can also execute it through our web development, SEO, and marketing services. Alternatively, we provide consulting to guide your internal team through implementation.",
      "brandIdentity1Q": "How long does brand identity design take?",
      "brandIdentity1A": "A complete brand identity including strategy, logo, colour palette, typography, and guidelines takes four to six weeks. The process includes multiple concept presentations and refinement rounds.",
      "brandIdentity2Q": "How many logo concepts do you present?",
      "brandIdentity2A": "We present three to five distinct logo concepts, each exploring a different creative direction. After you select a direction, we refine it through two to three rounds of revisions to perfection.",
      "brandIdentity3Q": "Do you provide brand guidelines?",
      "brandIdentity3A": "Yes. Every brand identity project includes a comprehensive guidelines document covering logo usage, colour specifications, typography rules, imagery direction, and tone of voice recommendations.",
      "brandIdentity4Q": "Can you redesign our existing brand identity?",
      "brandIdentity4A": "Yes. We can either refresh your existing brand with modernised elements or create an entirely new identity. We assess which approach serves your business goals best during the strategy phase.",
      "designSystems1Q": "What is a design system?",
      "designSystems1A": "A design system is a collection of reusable components, design tokens, and guidelines that ensure consistency across your digital products. It is the single source of truth for how your products look and behave.",
      "designSystems2Q": "When does a business need a design system?",
      "designSystems2A": "When you have multiple digital products, multiple teams contributing to the same product, or inconsistency in your UI. Design systems pay for themselves through reduced development time and improved consistency.",
      "designSystems3Q": "Do you build design systems in both Figma and code?",
      "designSystems3A": "Yes. Our design systems include Figma component libraries with auto-layout and variants, plus React component libraries with TypeScript and Storybook. Both libraries use matching naming conventions.",
      "designSystems4Q": "How do you handle design system governance?",
      "designSystems4A": "We establish contribution guidelines, review processes, and versioning strategies. New components follow a proposal, design, build, and release workflow. Breaking changes include migration guides.",
      "prototyping1Q": "What fidelity level is right for my project?",
      "prototyping1A": "Low-fidelity wireframes test navigation and flow concepts. Medium-fidelity tests visual design and interactions. High-fidelity tests the complete experience. We recommend the lowest fidelity that answers your validation questions.",
      "prototyping2Q": "How quickly can you build a prototype?",
      "prototyping2A": "Low-fidelity wireframe prototypes in one to two days. Medium-fidelity interactive prototypes in three to five days. High-fidelity coded prototypes in one to two weeks depending on complexity.",

      "prototyping4Q": "Can a prototype be used for investor presentations?",
      "prototyping4A": "Absolutely. High-fidelity prototypes are nearly indistinguishable from real products. They demonstrate your concept convincingly for investor pitches, board presentations, and stakeholder buy-in meetings.",
      "contentMarketing1Q": "How is content marketing different from blogging?",
      "contentMarketing1A": "Content marketing is a strategic approach that includes blogs, case studies, guides, whitepapers, and more. Each piece serves a specific business objective and targets defined audience segments at different buyer journey stages.",
      "contentMarketing2Q": "How long until content marketing generates leads?",
      "contentMarketing2A": "Content marketing is a compounding investment. Initial results in organic traffic appear in two to three months. Meaningful lead generation typically starts at four to six months with consistent, strategic publishing.",
      "contentMarketing3Q": "Do you create content in multiple European languages?",
      "contentMarketing3A": "Yes. We create and adapt content in English, French, Dutch, and German. Each language version is culturally adapted rather than directly translated, ensuring it resonates with the local audience.",
      "contentMarketing4Q": "What types of content convert best for B2B?",
      "contentMarketing4A": "Case studies and comparison guides are the highest-converting B2B content types. They provide social proof and help buyers evaluate options. Blog posts drive awareness, while guides and whitepapers generate email signups.",
      "customApps1Q": "How long does it take to build a custom web application?",
      "customApps1A": "A simple dashboard or portal takes 4-8 weeks. A mid-complexity application with authentication, roles, and integrations takes 8-16 weeks. Complex SaaS platforms can take 16-24 weeks. We deliver working increments every two weeks so you see progress and can provide feedback early and often.",
      "customApps2Q": "What backend technology do you use for custom applications?",
      "customApps2A": "Our primary backend is Supabase, providing PostgreSQL, real-time subscriptions, authentication, storage, and edge functions. For complex business logic, we add Node.js microservices. This combination delivers enterprise-grade capabilities without the cost and complexity of traditional backend infrastructure.",
      "customApps3Q": "How do you handle data security in custom applications?",
      "customApps3A": "Security is built into every layer: row-level security in PostgreSQL, JWT authentication with refresh token rotation, input validation with Zod schemas, rate limiting on all endpoints, and encryption in transit and at rest. We follow OWASP security guidelines and conduct security reviews before every production deployment.",
      "customApps4Q": "Can you integrate with our existing business systems?",
      "customApps4A": "Yes, we build API integrations with CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce), accounting software (Xero, QuickBooks), ERP systems, and any tool with a REST or GraphQL API. We design integration layers with proper error handling and retry logic so your systems stay synchronized reliably.",
      "redesign1Q": "Will a redesign affect our current Google rankings?",
      "redesign1A": "When done correctly, a redesign should improve your rankings. We create comprehensive 301 redirect maps, preserve existing URL structures where possible, maintain or improve content quality, and monitor Search Console closely post-launch. Our migration checklist covers 87 items specifically to prevent traffic loss during the transition.",
      "redesign2Q": "How long does a website redesign typically take?",
      "redesign2A": "A small business site (5-10 pages) takes 3-5 weeks including the audit phase. A larger site with 20+ pages, e-commerce, or complex functionality takes 6-12 weeks. We always begin with a two-week audit and strategy phase to ensure the redesign is driven by data rather than assumptions.",
      "redesign3Q": "Can we keep our current CMS during a redesign?",
      "redesign3A": "If your current CMS works well for your editors, we can use it as a headless backend and build a modern React frontend that consumes its content via API. This gives you a fast new website without requiring your team to learn a new content management system. WordPress to headless is our most common migration path.",
      "redesign4Q": "What if our current site is on WordPress -- can you still redesign it?",
      "redesign4A": "Yes, WordPress redesigns are our most frequent project type. We either build a custom React frontend using WordPress as a headless CMS, or migrate content entirely to a modern stack like Next.js with Payload CMS. The approach depends on your team's comfort with content management and your long-term technology goals.",
      "maintenance1Q": "What does your monthly care plan include?",
      "maintenance1A": "Our EUR 97/month care plan includes weekly dependency updates, monthly security scans, uptime monitoring with alerts, daily automated backups, content updates within one business day, monthly performance reports, priority support with 4-hour response time, and quarterly strategy reviews with optimization recommendations.",

      "maintenance3Q": "Can you maintain a website that someone else built?",
      "maintenance3A": "Yes, we maintain sites built by other agencies or developers, provided the codebase is in a modern framework we support (React, Next.js, Vue, or standard HTML/CSS). We begin with a codebase audit to understand the architecture, identify technical debt, and establish a baseline before starting regular maintenance.",
      "maintenance4Q": "What happens if we want to cancel the care plan?",
      "maintenance4A": "Our care plans require a 30-day notice to cancel. Upon cancellation, we provide full access to all source code, hosting credentials, and documentation. We also offer a transition period where we brief your new developer or agency on the codebase architecture and ongoing maintenance requirements.",
      "gdpr1Q": "What does GDPR compliance require for a business website?",
      "gdpr1A": "At minimum: a cookie consent banner that blocks non-essential cookies until consent, a comprehensive privacy policy, explicit consent checkboxes on forms, data processing agreements with third-party tools, and the ability to handle data subject requests (access, deletion, portability). The specifics vary by country and the data you collect.",
      "gdpr2Q": "Is a simple cookie banner enough for GDPR compliance?",
      "gdpr2A": "No. A compliant cookie banner must block all non-essential scripts before consent, offer granular category choices (not just accept/reject), store consent proof with timestamps, and allow users to change their preferences. Many popular cookie banner solutions are not actually compliant. We implement Consent Mode v2 which meets the strictest EU requirements.",
      "gdpr3Q": "Do we need a Data Protection Officer (DPO)?",
      "gdpr3A": "GDPR requires a DPO for public authorities, organizations processing data at scale, or those handling sensitive data categories. Most small to medium European businesses do not need a formal DPO, but they do need someone responsible for data protection. We can advise on your specific obligation and connect you with DPO consultants if needed.",
      "gdpr4Q": "How do you handle GDPR for multilingual websites?",
      "gdpr4A": "Privacy policies and cookie consent must be available in every language your website supports. We draft legally compliant policies in English, French, Dutch, and German, adapting to country-specific requirements (German UWG requires double opt-in for newsletters, French CNIL has specific cookie guidelines). Each language version references the applicable local regulations.",
      "wooDev1Q": "Why choose WooCommerce over Shopify for European e-commerce?",
      "wooDev1A": "WooCommerce offers full code ownership, no monthly platform fees, unlimited customisation, and no transaction fees beyond your payment provider's charges. It is ideal for businesses needing custom plugins, complex tax setups, or integration with specific European ERP systems.",
      "wooDev2Q": "Which payment gateways do you integrate with WooCommerce?",
      "wooDev2A": "We integrate Mollie (iDEAL, Bancontact, Belfius), Stripe, Adyen, Klarna, PayPal, and SEPA direct debit. Each gateway is configured with PSD2-compliant 3D Secure authentication and tested with real transactions before launch.",
      "wooDev3Q": "How do you handle EU VAT compliance in WooCommerce?",
      "wooDev3A": "We configure automatic VAT rate calculation per EU country, implement VAT number validation via VIES for B2B reverse charge, set up OSS reporting for cross-border sales, and ensure all invoices meet EU electronic invoicing requirements.",
      "wooDev4Q": "Can WooCommerce handle high traffic volumes?",
      "wooDev4A": "With proper hosting, caching, and optimisation, WooCommerce handles thousands of concurrent users. We configure Redis object caching, CDN delivery, database optimisation, and autoscaling infrastructure for peak traffic periods like Black Friday.",
      "customEcom1Q": "When should a business choose custom e-commerce over Shopify or WooCommerce?",
      "customEcom1A": "Custom development is the right choice when your business model requires unique checkout flows, complex product configurators, marketplace functionality, or deep integrations that standard platforms cannot accommodate without excessive workarounds.",
      "customEcom2Q": "What headless commerce backends do you work with?",
      "customEcom2A": "We work with Medusa.js for open-source flexibility, Saleor for GraphQL-first architecture, and Commercetools for enterprise-scale operations. Backend selection depends on your transaction volume, customisation needs, and budget.",
      "customEcom3Q": "How long does a custom e-commerce build take?",
      "customEcom3A": "A custom store typically takes 8 to 16 weeks depending on complexity. We work in two-week sprints with continuous delivery, so you see working functionality from week two onward rather than waiting for a big-bang launch.",
      "customEcom4Q": "What about ongoing maintenance for a custom store?",
      "customEcom4A": "We offer maintenance plans covering security updates, performance monitoring, bug fixes, and feature enhancements. Custom stores require more technical maintenance than hosted platforms, but you gain complete control and zero platform lock-in.",
      "b2bEcom1Q": "How does B2B e-commerce pricing work with customer-specific rates?",
      "b2bEcom1A": "Each customer account is assigned to a pricing tier with pre-negotiated rates. When buyers log in, they see only their contracted prices. Volume discounts are calculated automatically at checkout, and sales teams can override pricing for special orders.",
      "b2bEcom2Q": "Can the platform handle ordering by CSV upload?",
      "b2bEcom2A": "Yes. Bulk ordering supports CSV upload with SKU and quantity columns, quick-order forms for entering multiple products, and saved order templates for repeat purchases. These features are essential for B2B buyers who order dozens of items at once.",
      "b2bEcom3Q": "How do you handle VAT for cross-border B2B sales in the EU?",
      "b2bEcom3A": "We validate buyer VAT numbers against the EU VIES database in real time. Valid B2B buyers from other EU member states automatically receive reverse charge treatment with zero VAT. All transaction data is captured for Intrastat and EC Sales List reporting.",
      "b2bEcom4Q": "Can the B2B store integrate with our existing ERP system?",
      "b2bEcom4A": "Yes. We build integrations with SAP Business One, Microsoft Dynamics, Exact Online, and other European ERP systems. Product data, pricing, stock levels, and orders sync bidirectionally so your online store and back-office stay aligned.",
      "paymentInt1Q": "Which payment method has the highest conversion rate in Europe?",
      "paymentInt1A": "It varies by country. iDEAL converts at over 90 percent in the Netherlands, Bancontact dominates Belgium, and Klarna leads in Germany and Scandinavia. Card payments remain important across all markets. We recommend offering three to four methods per market.",
      "paymentInt2Q": "What is PSD2 and how does it affect our checkout?",
      "paymentInt2A": "PSD2 requires Strong Customer Authentication for European card payments, typically via 3D Secure 2.0. We implement frictionless authentication flows that minimise checkout abandonment while meeting regulatory requirements. Exemptions are applied where eligible.",
      "paymentInt3Q": "How do you handle recurring payments and subscriptions?",
      "paymentInt3A": "We implement SEPA direct debit for eurozone recurring payments and Stripe's subscription billing for card-based recurring charges. Mandate management, payment retry logic, and dunning workflows are all configured to minimise involuntary churn.",
      "paymentInt4Q": "What happens if a payment provider has downtime?",
      "paymentInt4A": "We configure fallback payment routes where possible. If Mollie experiences downtime, customers can still pay via Stripe. Webhook-based status tracking ensures orders are not lost during provider interruptions. Alert monitoring notifies you immediately of any issues.",
      "ecomSeo1Q": "How is e-commerce SEO different from regular website SEO?",
      "ecomSeo1A": "E-commerce SEO involves product schema markup, faceted navigation management, thin content on product pages, index bloat from filter combinations, and Google Shopping feed optimisation. These challenges require specialised techniques beyond standard on-page SEO.",
      "ecomSeo2Q": "Can you optimise our Google Shopping listings?",
      "ecomSeo2A": "Yes. We set up and optimise your Google Merchant Center feed with proper product titles, descriptions, GTINs, and pricing data. Feed rules ensure your products show correctly across all target markets with localised pricing and availability.",
      "ecomSeo3Q": "How do you handle SEO for products with many variants?",
      "ecomSeo3A": "We implement canonical URLs to consolidate ranking signals across variants, use structured data to surface variant options in search results, and create optimised descriptions that target variant-specific search queries like colour or size combinations.",
      "ecomSeo4Q": "What results can we expect from e-commerce SEO?",
      "ecomSeo4A": "Typically, we see 30 to 80 percent increases in organic product page traffic within six months. Product rich results improve click-through rates by 20 to 35 percent. Google Shopping feed optimisation can double impression share in target markets.",
      "ecomAnalytics1Q": "What is GA4 enhanced e-commerce tracking?",
      "ecomAnalytics1A": "Enhanced e-commerce tracks the complete shopping journey: product views, add-to-cart actions, checkout steps, purchases, and refunds. Each event carries product details enabling analysis of which products, categories, and price points drive revenue.",
      "ecomAnalytics2Q": "How do you handle tracking accuracy with ad blockers?",
      "ecomAnalytics2A": "We implement server-side tracking through Google Tag Manager's server container. This routes analytics data through your own domain, bypassing most ad blockers. Consent mode v2 ensures GDPR compliance while recovering up to 70 percent of blocked data.",
      "ecomAnalytics3Q": "What KPIs should an e-commerce store track?",
      "ecomAnalytics3A": "Essential KPIs include conversion rate, average order value, revenue per visitor, cart abandonment rate, customer acquisition cost, and customer lifetime value. We build dashboards that surface these metrics by market, channel, and device for European stores.",
      "ecomAnalytics4Q": "Can you set up analytics for stores selling in multiple EU countries?",
      "ecomAnalytics4A": "Yes. We configure market-segmented reporting so you can compare performance across countries. Cross-domain tracking handles multi-language storefronts, and currency normalisation ensures revenue comparisons are accurate regardless of the transaction currency.",
      "intlSeo1Q": "Should I use separate domains for each country or subdirectories?",
      "intlSeo1A": "For most European businesses, subdirectories (example.com/fr/, example.com/de/) offer the best balance of authority consolidation and geo-targeting. Country-code domains are better only when you have strong existing domain authority per market.",
      "intlSeo2Q": "How do you handle keyword research in languages you do not speak natively?",
      "intlSeo2A": "We work with native-speaking SEO specialists for each target language. Machine translation misses search intent nuances. Our French, Dutch, and German keyword research reflects actual local search behaviour, not translated English queries.",
      "intlSeo3Q": "What is hreflang and why does it matter for my site?",
      "intlSeo3A": "Hreflang tells Google which language and country each page targets, preventing the wrong version from ranking in the wrong market. Without it, your French page might rank in the UK, cannibalising your English page's traffic.",
      "intlSeo4Q": "Can international SEO work alongside Google Ads for new markets?",
      "intlSeo4A": "Absolutely. We often recommend Google Ads for immediate visibility in new markets while international SEO builds organic presence over 3-6 months. The keyword data from ads informs SEO strategy for faster results.",
      "marketingAuto1Q": "Which marketing automation platform do you recommend?",
      "marketingAuto1A": "It depends on your needs and budget. Mailchimp suits small businesses and e-commerce. HubSpot is ideal for B2B with complex sales cycles. ActiveCampaign offers the best automation features for its price. We help you choose the right fit.",
      "marketingAuto2Q": "How do you ensure automated emails comply with GDPR?",
      "marketingAuto2A": "Every automation includes proper consent capture, easy unsubscribe in every email, data processing documentation, and retention policies. We configure double opt-in for European contacts and maintain suppression lists across all platforms.",
      "marketingAuto3Q": "What kind of ROI can I expect from marketing automation?",
      "marketingAuto3A": "Clients typically see 15-25% increases in lead-to-customer conversion rates within the first quarter. Automated nurture sequences recover leads that would otherwise go cold, and cart abandonment emails alone can recover 10-15% of lost revenue.",
      "marketingAuto4Q": "Can automation work with my existing CRM system?",
      "marketingAuto4A": "Yes. We integrate with Salesforce, HubSpot CRM, Pipedrive, and most modern CRM platforms via native integrations or Zapier. Bi-directional sync ensures your sales team sees every marketing touchpoint in their existing workflow.",
      "geoOpt1Q": "What is the difference between GEO and traditional SEO?",
      "geoOpt1A": "Traditional SEO optimises for search engine result pages. GEO optimises for AI-generated answers in platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity. Both are important, but GEO specifically targets how AI systems cite and recommend your brand.",
      "geoOpt2Q": "Can I track whether AI platforms are mentioning my brand?",
      "geoOpt2A": "Yes. We use a combination of manual query testing across AI platforms and emerging monitoring tools to track brand mentions, accuracy, and sentiment in AI-generated responses. Monthly reports show visibility trends.",
      "geoOpt3Q": "Is GEO relevant for small European businesses or only large brands?",
      "geoOpt3A": "GEO is relevant for any business whose customers use AI search. Local service businesses benefit when ChatGPT or Google AI Overviews recommend providers. Early adoption creates a competitive advantage as AI search usage grows rapidly.",
      "geoOpt4Q": "How quickly does GEO optimisation show results?",
      "geoOpt4A": "AI systems update their knowledge bases at different rates. Google AI Overviews reflect changes within weeks. ChatGPT and Perplexity may take 1-3 months to surface new citations. Early and consistent effort compounds into strong AI visibility.",
      "mobileFirst1Q": "Why should we design mobile-first instead of desktop-first?",
      "mobileFirst1A": "Over sixty percent of European web traffic comes from mobile devices. Designing mobile-first forces content prioritisation, cleaner hierarchy and faster performance. Desktop enhancements are then added progressively, resulting in a better experience on every screen size.",
      "mobileFirst2Q": "How do you handle complex interfaces on small screens?",
      "mobileFirst2A": "We use progressive disclosure -- showing essential content first and revealing detail on demand through expandable sections, bottom sheets and contextual navigation. Complex data tables become swipeable cards. Multi-step forms are broken into focused single-field screens.",
      "mobileFirst3Q": "What performance targets do you aim for on mobile?",
      "mobileFirst3A": "We target sub-two-second Largest Contentful Paint on 4G connections, Total Blocking Time under 150 milliseconds and Cumulative Layout Shift below 0.05. These Core Web Vitals targets ensure fast loading, smooth interactivity and stable layouts on real devices.",
      "mobileFirst4Q": "Do you test on real devices or just browser emulators?",
      "mobileFirst4A": "Both. Initial development uses browser DevTools for rapid iteration, but final testing occurs on a physical device lab covering iOS Safari, Android Chrome, Samsung Internet and common viewport sizes. Network throttling simulates real 3G and 4G conditions in each target market."

      "longDesc": "Off-the-shelf software forces your business to adapt to its limitations. Custom web applications work the other way around -- they are built to match your specific workflows, data structures, and business rules. At DMC Kreatif, we develop bespoke web applications for European businesses that need more than a website: client portals where your customers track orders and invoices, internal dashboards that aggregate data from multiple sources, SaaS platforms that become revenue-generating products, and workflow automation tools that eliminate manual processes.\n\nOur application architecture is designed for reliability and scale. We use Supabase as our primary backend platform, providing PostgreSQL database with row-level security, real-time subscriptions for live data updates, edge functions for serverless business logic, and built-in authentication with social login providers. For applications that need more complex backend processing, we build Node.js microservices deployed as containerized workloads. Every application includes proper error boundaries, retry logic, and graceful degradation so your business operations continue even when third-party services experience outages.\n\nSecurity is paramount for applications handling business data. We implement role-based access control (RBAC) so administrators, managers, and regular users see only what they should. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. API endpoints are protected with rate limiting, input validation using Zod schemas, and CSRF protection. For applications processing personal data of European users, we ensure full GDPR compliance including data export functionality, right-to-deletion workflows, and audit logging of data access. We conduct security reviews using OWASP guidelines before every production deployment.\n\nWe build custom applications iteratively, delivering functional increments every two weeks. You get a working application early -- not a wireframe or a prototype, but actual software you can use and test with real data. Each sprint adds features based on prioritized requirements, and we adjust course based on your feedback. This approach reduces risk, surfaces issues early, and ensures the final application truly fits your business needs rather than an outdated specification document.",

      "longDesc": "Your website is often the first impression customers have of your business. If it looks outdated, loads slowly, or does not work well on mobile, you are losing customers every day. Our website redesign service transforms your online presence from a liability into your most effective sales tool.\n\nWe start every redesign project with a comprehensive audit of your current site. We analyse traffic data, user behaviour, conversion funnels, SEO performance, and technical health. This data tells us what is working, what is broken, and where the biggest opportunities lie. We do not redesign based on trends or personal preferences. We redesign based on evidence.\n\nThe design phase focuses on conversion optimisation alongside visual appeal. We restructure information architecture based on user journey mapping, ensuring visitors find what they need quickly. Call-to-action placement, form design, and trust signals are positioned based on best practices and your specific audience data. Every design decision has a reason behind it.\n\nMigration from your old platform to modern technology is handled carefully. Whether you are moving from WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, or a legacy CMS, we preserve your SEO equity with proper 301 redirects, URL mapping, and metadata migration. Your search rankings are protected throughout the transition with a detailed migration plan.\n\nThe technical rebuild uses React or Next.js with Tailwind CSS, delivering dramatically improved performance. Sites that previously scored 30-50 on Lighthouse consistently reach 95+ after our redesign. Page load times drop from 5-8 seconds to under 2 seconds. These improvements directly impact your search rankings and conversion rates.\n\nPost-launch, we monitor your analytics for 30 days to ensure the redesign delivers measurable improvement. We track key metrics including bounce rate, time on site, conversion rate, and organic traffic. If any metric moves in the wrong direction, we investigate and optimise immediately. Your redesign is not complete until the data confirms it is performing better than your old site.",

Without proactive maintenance, your site degrades over time: performance drops, security holes open, and search rankings slip. Our maintenance and support plans ensure your website stays fast, secure, and effective long after launch.\n\nOur standard care plan includes weekly dependency updates with compatibility testing before deployment, monthly security scans for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in your JavaScript packages, uptime monitoring with instant alerts if your site goes down, automated daily backups to a separate cloud storage location, and monthly performance reports showing Lighthouse scores, Core Web Vitals, and traffic trends. We handle everything proactively -- you do not need to think about server updates or security patches.\n\nContent updates are included in every care plan. Need to change your pricing, add a team member photo, update your portfolio with a new project, or modify your business hours?

      "longDesc": "GDPR compliance for websites is not just about adding a cookie banner -- it is a comprehensive approach to data protection that European regulators actively enforce. Fines under GDPR can reach EUR 20 million or 4% of global turnover, and enforcement has intensified significantly since 2022 with the French CNIL, German BfDI, and Dutch AP issuing penalties to businesses of all sizes. Our GDPR compliance service ensures your website handles personal data correctly, from the moment a visitor loads your page to the point their data is deleted.\n\nCookie consent is the most visible compliance requirement and the one most websites get wrong. We implement Consent Mode v2 with Google Tag Manager, which is required for running Google Ads in the EU since March 2024. Our implementation blocks all non-essential cookies and scripts until the user gives explicit consent, provides granular options (analytics, marketing, functional cookies as separate categories), stores consent proof with timestamp and user agent for audit purposes, and re-requests consent when your cookie policy changes. The consent banner adapts per country -- Germany requires strict opt-in while some other jurisdictions accept implied consent for analytics.\n\nBeyond cookies, we ensure your data collection points are fully compliant. Contact forms include explicit consent checkboxes with links to your privacy policy. Newsletter signups use double opt-in (required in Germany under UWG). File uploads are scanned and stored securely with access controls. Your privacy policy is written in plain language (GDPR Article 12 requires clear communication), covers all required disclosures including data retention periods, third-party processors, international transfers, and user rights, and is available in all languages your website supports.\n\nWe also implement the technical infrastructure for data subject rights. Users have the right to access their data, request corrections, demand deletion, and export their data in a portable format. We build these capabilities into your application: a self-service data export function, account deletion workflows that cascade through all data stores, and audit logging that records who accessed personal data and when. For businesses using Supabase, we configure row-level security policies that enforce data isolation between users and implement automatic data retention policies that delete inactive user data after your specified retention period.",

This gives us complete control over design, performance, and functionality. We build lightweight themes that load fast, look professional, and provide a seamless shopping experience. Product pages, category archives, cart, and checkout are all custom-designed for your brand and product types.\n\nEuropean payment integration is comprehensive.

      "longDesc": "B2B e-commerce is fundamentally different from B2C. Your customers need account-based pricing, bulk order capabilities, approval workflows, and integration with their procurement systems. Our B2B e-commerce solutions are built specifically for these requirements, serving European manufacturers, distributors, and wholesalers.\n\nAccount management is the foundation of B2B commerce. We build customer portals where buyers log in to see their negotiated pricing, order history, saved carts, and account balance. Sales representatives can manage their accounts, place orders on behalf of customers, and generate quotes. Multi-user accounts let different team members have different permissions within the same company.\n\nTiered pricing supports the complexity of B2B transactions. Volume-based discounts, customer-specific price lists, contract pricing, and promotional pricing all coexist in a flexible pricing engine. Prices can be set in multiple currencies with automatic conversion, and minimum order quantities ensure profitability on every transaction.\n\nBulk ordering is streamlined with quick-order forms where buyers enter SKUs and quantities directly, CSV upload for large orders, and reorder functionality that copies previous orders. The cart handles hundreds of line items without performance issues. Order approval workflows route large orders through internal approval chains before submission.\n\nIntegration with ERP systems like SAP, Microsoft Dynamics, and NetSuite ensures order data flows automatically to your fulfilment operations. Real-time inventory sync prevents overselling. Invoice generation and payment terms management handle net-30, net-60, and custom payment arrangements common in B2B transactions.\n\nThe platform is built for European B2B commerce with multilingual support, EU VAT handling with reverse charge mechanisms, cross-border shipping logistics, and compliance with electronic invoicing regulations. Analytics dashboards give sales teams visibility into customer buying patterns, reorder cycles, and revenue forecasts.",

Our payment integration service ensures your customers can pay securely, quickly, and with their preferred method, no matter where they are in Europe.\n\nStripe is our primary payment platform, supporting card payments, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and dozens of local payment methods from a single integration. We implement Stripe Elements for a customisable, PCI-compliant payment form that matches your brand design. Stripe's strong customer authentication handles 3D Secure requirements automatically for European card transactions.\n\nLocal payment methods are essential for European conversion rates. In the Netherlands, over 60% of online payments use iDEAL. In Belgium, Bancontact dominates. Germany favours Giropay and SOFORT. France uses Carte Bancaire. We integrate each relevant method for your target markets, either through Stripe's unified API or through dedicated providers like Mollie.\n\nKlarna integration adds buy-now-pay-later and instalment payment options that increase average order values and conversion rates. Customers can split purchases into interest-free instalments, pay within 30 days, or finance larger purchases. Klarna handles the credit risk while you receive full payment immediately.\n\nSEPA Direct Debit is ideal for recurring payments and subscriptions in the eurozone. We implement mandate collection, payment scheduling, and automatic retry logic for failed debits. Combined with Stripe Billing for subscription management, this creates a complete recurring revenue infrastructure.\n\nSecurity measures include PCI DSS compliance through tokenised payment processing, fraud detection with Stripe Radar, webhook signature verification, and idempotent payment processing to prevent duplicate charges.

Product pages, category pages, and faceted navigation create unique technical challenges, while the competitive landscape demands a strategic approach to keyword targeting. Our e-commerce SEO service helps European online stores rank higher and convert more organic traffic into sales.\n\nProduct page optimisation is where e-commerce SEO delivers the most direct revenue impact. We implement Product schema markup with price, availability, rating, and review data for rich search results. Product titles and descriptions are optimised for high-intent commercial keywords specific to each European market. Image optimisation with descriptive alt text and proper file naming improves image search visibility.\n\nCategory pages are the workhorses of e-commerce SEO. We optimise category page titles, descriptions, and content for broad commercial terms. Internal linking structures connect categories, subcategories, and products in a way that distributes page authority effectively. We handle the technical challenges of faceted navigation with proper canonical tags, noindex directives, and crawl budget management.\n\nGoogle Shopping optimisation extends your product visibility. We set up Google Merchant Center, create product feeds with accurate data, and optimise feed attributes for better Shopping ad performance. Product feed management includes automatic updates for price and stock changes, custom labels for campaign segmentation, and multi-country feeds for European markets.\n\nContent strategy drives long-term organic growth for e-commerce. We create buying guides, comparison articles, how-to content, and seasonal landing pages that attract customers in the research phase of their buying journey. Each piece of content targets specific keywords and links to relevant product pages, creating a content-to-commerce funnel.\n\nTechnical e-commerce SEO handles the complexities that standard SEO audits miss.

Our e-commerce analytics service implements comprehensive tracking, builds insightful dashboards, and provides the analysis you need to optimise your online store's performance.\n\nGoogle Analytics 4 enhanced e-commerce is the foundation. We implement tracking for every step of the customer journey: product impressions, product clicks, add to cart, begin checkout, add payment info, and purchase. Each event captures product details, transaction values, and customer attributes. This data reveals exactly where customers drop off and which products drive the most engagement.\n\nConversion funnel analysis identifies the leaks in your sales process. We build funnel visualisations showing the drop-off rate at each step from landing page to purchase confirmation. Heat map and session recording integration with tools like Microsoft Clarity shows exactly what customers do on key pages, revealing UX issues that analytics alone cannot explain.\n\nRevenue attribution connects marketing spend to actual sales. We implement UTM tracking, cross-domain tracking for multi-site setups, and data import from Google Ads and social media platforms. Multi-touch attribution models show which channels contribute to conversions, helping you allocate budget to the highest-performing sources.\n\nCustom dashboards in Looker Studio or your preferred platform present the metrics that matter to your business. Daily revenue, conversion rate, average order value, cart abandonment rate, product performance, and customer lifetime value are displayed clearly with trend comparisons. Automated reports are delivered weekly or monthly to stakeholders.\n\nGDPR-compliant implementation is critical for European e-commerce.

      "longDesc": "International SEO is fundamentally different from domestic SEO. Ranking in multiple European countries requires market-specific strategies, proper technical implementation, and cultural understanding of each audience. Our international SEO service helps European businesses expand their organic reach across borders with strategies tailored to each target market.\n\nMarket-specific keyword research is the starting point. Search behaviour varies significantly between countries. A French business owner searches differently from a British one, even when looking for the same service. We conduct keyword research in each target language using native understanding of search intent, colloquialisms, and industry terminology. This is not translation — it is market-native research.\n\nHreflang implementation is the technical backbone of international SEO. We ensure every page correctly signals its language and regional targeting to search engines. Hreflang tags in HTML headers or XML sitemaps prevent duplicate content issues between language versions and ensure the right page appears for users in each country. We handle complex scenarios including regional variants, language fallbacks, and x-default targeting.\n\nURL structure strategy determines how your international content is organised. We recommend the right approach for your situation: subdirectories for most businesses, subdomains for significantly different products per market, or country-code domains for maximum local authority. Each approach has trade-offs that we evaluate based on your specific goals and resources.\n\nContent localisation goes beyond translation. Each market version of your content is adapted for local culture, business norms, legal requirements, and user expectations. Case studies reference local clients, pricing reflects local currency, and calls to action use locally appropriate language. This cultural adaptation dramatically improves engagement and conversion rates.\n\nInternational link building strengthens your authority in each target market. We build relationships with local industry publications, participate in regional directories, and create linkable content that resonates with each national audience. Domain authority in one country does not automatically transfer to another, so market-specific link building is essential.\n\nPerformance is tracked per market with country-specific ranking reports, organic traffic segmentation, and conversion rate analysis by language.

Marketing automation closes this gap by delivering the right message to the right person at the right time, automatically. Our service designs and implements automation systems that nurture leads through your sales funnel with personalised, timely communication that feels human even at scale.\n\nWe work with the leading automation platforms including Mailchimp, HubSpot, ActiveCampaign, and Brevo (formerly Sendinblue), choosing the best fit based on your business size, budget, and integration requirements. Setup includes CRM integration to ensure your sales team sees every interaction, proper list segmentation based on behaviour and demographics, and custom fields that capture the data points that matter for your business. For European businesses, we ensure all automation complies with GDPR, including proper consent capture, easy unsubscribe mechanisms, and data processing documentation.\n\nEmail workflow design is where automation becomes powerful. We build automated sequences for every stage of your customer journey: welcome series for new subscribers, lead nurture sequences that educate and build trust, abandoned cart recovery for e-commerce, post-purchase follow-ups that drive reviews and repeat business, and re-engagement campaigns for inactive contacts. Each workflow includes A/B tested subject lines, personalised content blocks, optimal send time analysis, and clear performance tracking. Multilingual workflows handle French, English, Dutch, and German contacts with content in their preferred language.\n\nLead scoring quantifies buying intent so your sales team focuses on the hottest prospects. We define scoring models based on engagement signals: email opens, link clicks, page visits, form submissions, and time on site. Scores trigger automated actions like sales notifications, pipeline stage changes, or escalated nurture content.

      "longDesc": "The search landscape is undergoing its most significant shift since Google replaced directories. AI-powered search platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and Microsoft Copilot are increasingly the first place people go for answers. These systems synthesise information from across the web and present direct answers, often without requiring a click to your website. If your brand is not part of those synthesised answers, you are invisible to a growing segment of your audience. Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the discipline of ensuring your brand and content are cited by AI systems.\n\nGEO starts with understanding how large language models source information. AI systems prioritise content that demonstrates clear expertise, provides structured and quotable data points, maintains factual accuracy with citations, and comes from domains with established authority. We audit your content through the lens of AI retrievability: Is your content structured in ways that AI can easily extract and cite? Do your pages contain clear, authoritative statements that AI would choose to reference? Are your entity relationships (brand, products, people) clearly defined across the web?\n\nOur optimisation approach targets the specific signals that AI search platforms weight. We implement comprehensive entity markup using Schema.org vocabulary so AI systems can accurately identify and categorise your business, services, and expertise. We create content specifically designed for AI citation: definitive statistics, expert-attributed insights, structured comparisons, and authoritative how-to content. We optimise your presence on platforms that AI systems heavily reference, including Wikipedia, industry databases, major publications, and structured knowledge sources.\n\nFor European businesses, GEO includes multilingual AI visibility. ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews serve responses in the user's language, drawing from content in that language. We ensure your brand is well-represented in French, English, Dutch, and German AI results. We also monitor your AI search visibility using emerging tools and manual query testing, tracking how often your brand is mentioned, how accurately it is represented, and where competitors are being cited instead. This is a rapidly evolving field, and our strategies adapt as AI search capabilities expand.",

      "longDesc": "Mobile traffic accounts for over 60% of web visits in Europe. Google uses mobile-first indexing, meaning your mobile experience determines your search rankings. Yet many websites are still designed for desktop and squeezed onto mobile as an afterthought. Our mobile-first design service flips this approach, creating experiences that are exceptional on mobile and scale up beautifully to larger screens.\n\nMobile-first means we design the mobile experience before the desktop experience. This constraint forces prioritisation of the most important content and actions. When you have limited screen space, every element must earn its place. This clarity of purpose benefits the desktop experience too, resulting in cleaner, more focused designs at every screen size.\n\nTouch interaction design considers how people actually use mobile devices. We design touch targets that are at least 44x44 pixels for comfortable tapping. Navigation patterns are optimised for thumb reach zones. Swipe gestures are used where they feel natural. Pull-to-refresh, bottom navigation, and floating action buttons follow mobile platform conventions that users already understand.\n\nResponsive typography and spacing scale proportionally across devices using CSS clamp functions. Headings that fill a mobile screen are proportionally impactful on desktop without being absurdly large. Line lengths are controlled for readability at every width. Spacing increases with screen size to prevent large-screen designs from feeling cramped.\n\nPerformance on mobile networks is a design constraint we take seriously. Images are served in appropriate sizes for each device with srcset and sizes attributes. Above-the-fold content is prioritised for immediate rendering. JavaScript is minimised and deferred. These techniques ensure your website loads fast even on 3G connections common in some European areas.\n\nWe test on real devices throughout the design and development process. iOS Safari, Android Chrome, Samsung Internet, and other mobile browsers each have quirks that only real device testing reveals. We test across screen sizes from 320px to 428px on phones, 768px to 1024px on tablets, and 1280px and above on desktop. The result is a website that feels native on every device.",

Framer Motion's variants system lets us define animation states declaratively, keeping our code clean and maintainable.\n\nThe library's performance is exceptional. Framer Motion uses hardware-accelerated CSS transforms by default, animates at 60fps on mobile devices, and supports the Web Animations API for maximum efficiency. Its AnimatePresence component handles exit animations gracefully, something that's notoriously difficult with CSS alone.",

      "react1Q": "Why does DMC Kreatif use React for web development?",
      "react1A": "React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM make it the ideal choice for building fast, scalable web applications. With 220K+ GitHub stars and millions of developers, React ensures long-term maintainability and access to the largest ecosystem of UI libraries.",
      "react2Q": "Is React suitable for SEO-heavy websites?",
      "react2A": "Yes — when paired with Next.js for server-side rendering. We use React with Next.js for SEO-critical projects, ensuring search engines can crawl and index all content while maintaining React's interactive capabilities.",
      "react3Q": "How long does it take to build a React website?",
      "react3A": "A typical React website takes 2-4 weeks depending on complexity. Simple landing pages can be delivered in under a week, while full-featured applications with authentication and dashboards take 4-8 weeks.",
      "react4Q": "Can you migrate my existing website to React?",
      "react4A": "Absolutely. We specialise in migrating websites from WordPress, jQuery, and legacy frameworks to modern React. Our phased migration approach ensures zero downtime and preserves your existing SEO rankings.",
      "react5Q": "What is the cost of a React development project?",
      "react5A": "React projects start from €497 for single-page applications. Multi-page sites with advanced features range from €997-€2,997. Contact us for a free consultation and custom quote tailored to your requirements.",
      "nextjs1Q": "When should I choose Next.js over plain React?",
      "nextjs1A": "Choose Next.js when SEO is critical, when you need server-side rendering, or when building a multilingual site. For pure single-page apps or client dashboards where SEO doesn't matter, Vite + React is faster and lighter.",
      "nextjs2Q": "Does Next.js improve SEO compared to React?",
      "nextjs2A": "Yes, significantly. Next.js's server-side rendering sends fully rendered HTML to search engines, while client-side React sends empty HTML. This leads to faster indexing, better rankings, and improved Core Web Vitals scores.",
      "nextjs3Q": "Can Next.js handle multilingual websites?",
      "nextjs3A": "Next.js has built-in i18n routing that makes multilingual sites straightforward. We configure locale detection, URL prefixes (en, fr, nl, de), and alternate hreflang tags automatically for all European markets.",
      "nextjs4Q": "What hosting does DMC Kreatif use for Next.js?",
      "nextjs4A": "We deploy Next.js applications on Vercel, the platform built by the Next.js creators. This ensures optimal performance, automatic CI/CD, and a global edge network with 100+ points of presence across Europe.",
      "nextjs5Q": "How does Next.js compare to WordPress for business websites?",
      "nextjs5A": "Next.js delivers 3-5x faster page loads, perfect Lighthouse scores, and built-in security — no plugins, updates, or hack vulnerabilities. For businesses that need a CMS, we pair Next.js with headless WordPress for the best of both worlds.",
      "typescript1Q": "Why do you use TypeScript instead of JavaScript?",
      "typescript1A": "TypeScript catches 15-20% of bugs at compile time that would otherwise reach production. It makes code self-documenting, enables powerful IDE autocomplete, and is now the industry standard used by 78% of professional JavaScript developers.",
      "typescript2Q": "Does TypeScript slow down development?",
      "typescript2A": "Initially there's a small overhead, but TypeScript pays for itself quickly. Fewer bugs mean less debugging time, better autocomplete means faster coding, and explicit types mean faster onboarding for new team members.",
      "typescript3Q": "Can TypeScript work with my existing JavaScript code?",
      "typescript3A": "Yes — TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so all valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript. We can migrate incrementally, adding types file by file, with zero disruption to your existing application.",
      "typescript4Q": "Is TypeScript required for React projects?",
      "typescript4A": "Not technically required, but strongly recommended. TypeScript prevents entire categories of runtime errors, makes React prop types explicit, and is supported out of the box by Create React App, Vite, and Next.js.",
      "typescript5Q": "What TypeScript configuration does DMC Kreatif use?",
      "typescript5A": "We use strict mode with all checks enabled: strictNullChecks, noImplicitAny, noUncheckedIndexedAccess, and exactOptionalPropertyTypes. This catches the maximum number of bugs at compile time.",
      "vite1Q": "Why does DMC Kreatif use Vite instead of Webpack?",
      "vite1A": "Vite's native ES module development server starts instantly regardless of project size, while Webpack can take 30+ seconds. HMR updates in under 50ms versus Webpack's 1-2 seconds. For production, Vite produces smaller bundles via Rollup.",
      "vite2Q": "Is Vite production-ready for enterprise projects?",
      "vite2A": "Absolutely. Vite is used by Shopify, Google, Apple, and thousands of production applications. With Rollup under the hood for production builds, it produces highly optimised, battle-tested output.",
      "vite3Q": "Can I migrate from Webpack to Vite?",
      "vite3A": "Yes — most Webpack projects can migrate to Vite within a few hours. Vite supports most Webpack loader equivalents through its plugin system, and we handle the migration as part of our modernisation service.",
      "vite4Q": "Does Vite work with TypeScript and React?",
      "vite4A": "Vite has first-class TypeScript and React support with zero configuration. Simply create a .tsx file and it works. Vite uses esbuild for TypeScript transpilation, making it 20-30x faster than the TypeScript compiler.",
      "vite5Q": "What is the difference between Vite and Next.js?",
      "vite5A": "Vite is a build tool for client-side applications, while Next.js is a full-stack framework with SSR. Use Vite for SPAs, dashboards, and internal tools. Use Next.js when you need SEO, server-side rendering, or API routes.",
      "tailwindcss1Q": "Why Tailwind CSS instead of Bootstrap or custom CSS?",
      "tailwindcss1A": "Tailwind's utility-first approach produces 80-95% smaller CSS bundles than Bootstrap. Unlike custom CSS, Tailwind enforces consistency through design tokens and eliminates naming conflicts. Every site looks unique, not like a Bootstrap template.",
      "tailwindcss2Q": "Does Tailwind CSS affect website performance?",
      "tailwindcss2A": "Tailwind actually improves performance. The JIT compiler generates only the CSS classes you use, resulting in production stylesheets under 10KB. Compare this to Bootstrap's 150KB+ or typical custom CSS of 50-200KB.",
      "tailwindcss3Q": "Can Tailwind CSS create unique, branded designs?",
      "tailwindcss3A": "Absolutely. Our neo-brutalist design system is built entirely with Tailwind CSS. Custom colours, typography, spacing, and animations are defined in the config, ensuring every site has a unique brand identity — not a generic template look.",
      "tailwindcss4Q": "Is Tailwind CSS harder to maintain than regular CSS?",
      "tailwindcss4A": "It's actually easier. With Tailwind, styles are co-located with components, so you never hunt for CSS files. Refactoring is safer because styles are scoped. And the design token system prevents colour and spacing drift over time.",
      "tailwindcss5Q": "Does DMC Kreatif use Tailwind CSS v4?",
      "tailwindcss5A": "Yes, we use Tailwind CSS v4 which introduced a new CSS-first configuration, the Oxide engine for faster builds, and automatic content detection. This means even faster build times and a simpler developer experience.",
      "framerMotion1Q": "Why use Framer Motion instead of CSS animations?",
      "framerMotion1A": "CSS animations can't handle exit animations, layout changes, or gesture-driven interactions. Framer Motion's declarative API makes complex animation sequences simple while maintaining 60fps performance through hardware acceleration.",
      "framerMotion2Q": "Do animations slow down website performance?",
      "framerMotion2A": "Not when done correctly. Framer Motion uses GPU-accelerated transforms by default, keeping animations off the main thread. Our animation system is optimised for Core Web Vitals — all animations use will-change and composite-only properties.",
      "framerMotion3Q": "What types of animations does DMC Kreatif implement?",
      "framerMotion3A": "Scroll-triggered reveals, page transitions, hover micro-interactions, staggered list animations, counter animations for statistics, parallax effects, and gesture-driven interfaces. Every animation serves a purpose in the UX.",
      "framerMotion4Q": "Can animations be disabled for accessibility?",
      "framerMotion4A": "Yes. We implement the prefers-reduced-motion media query across all projects. Users who prefer reduced motion see instant state changes instead of animations, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.",
      "framerMotion5Q": "Is Framer Motion included in all DMC Kreatif projects?",
      "framerMotion5A": "Framer Motion is part of our standard stack for all React projects. It's lightweight (just 32KB gzipped), tree-shakeable, and provides the animation capabilities needed for our premium, agency-quality user experiences.",
      "supabase1Q": "Why does DMC Kreatif choose Supabase over Firebase?",
      "supabase1A": "Supabase uses PostgreSQL (not NoSQL), supports EU hosting for GDPR compliance, offers Row-Level Security, has no vendor lock-in, and provides a more generous free tier. For European businesses, it's the superior choice.",
      "supabase2Q": "Is Supabase GDPR compliant?",

      "supabase4Q": "How much does Supabase cost?",
      "supabase4A": "Supabase has a generous free tier (50K monthly active users, 500MB database, 1GB storage). The Pro plan at $25/month covers most business needs. Compare this to Firebase's unpredictable usage-based pricing.",
      "supabase5Q": "Can Supabase handle e-commerce backends?",
      "supabase5A": "Yes. We use Supabase for custom e-commerce with product catalogues, user accounts, order management, and payment processing via Stripe/LemonSqueezy integration. Row-Level Security ensures secure multi-tenant data access.",

      "vercel2Q": "How fast are websites hosted on Vercel?",
      "vercel2A": "Vercel's edge network has 100+ points of presence worldwide. Static assets load in under 50ms, and server-rendered pages in under 200ms. Our Vercel-deployed sites consistently achieve sub-1-second Largest Contentful Paint.",
      "vercel3Q": "Is Vercel suitable for business-critical websites?",
      "vercel3A": "Vercel provides 99.99% uptime SLA on Enterprise plans, DDoS protection, automatic HTTPS, and instant rollbacks. Clients include GitHub, McDonald's, and The Washington Post — it's battle-tested at any scale.",
      "vercel4Q": "How does Vercel handle deployments?",
      "vercel4A": "Push to Git and Vercel automatically builds, tests, and deploys. Every branch gets a unique preview URL for stakeholder review. Production deploys are atomic — if a build fails, the previous version stays live.",
      "vercel5Q": "What is the cost of hosting on Vercel?",
      "vercel5A": "Vercel's Hobby plan is free for personal projects. The Pro plan ($20/month) covers most business sites with unlimited bandwidth and 100GB. Enterprise plans include SLAs, priority support, and advanced analytics.",
      "shopify1Q": "Why choose Shopify for European e-commerce?",
      "shopify1A": "Shopify supports multi-currency checkout, EU payment gateways (iDEAL, Bancontact, Klarna), VAT handling, and GDPR-compliant data processing. Its 99.99% uptime and PCI compliance eliminate server management entirely.",
      "shopify2Q": "Can DMC Kreatif build custom Shopify themes?",
      "shopify2A": "Yes. We build both custom Liquid themes for traditional Shopify and Hydrogen-powered headless storefronts with React. Custom themes ensure your store has a unique brand identity, not a generic template look.",
      "shopify3Q": "How does headless Shopify work?",
      "shopify3A": "Headless Shopify uses the Storefront API to power a custom React frontend while Shopify handles the backend: checkout, payments, inventory, and orders. You get Shopify's reliability with our premium frontend experience.",
      "shopify4Q": "What Shopify apps does DMC Kreatif recommend?",
      "shopify4A": "We typically integrate Klaviyo (email marketing), Yotpo (reviews), ShipStation (shipping), and Privy (popups). For EU-specific needs: Mollie Payments, Sendcloud, and GDPR compliance apps.",
      "shopify5Q": "How long does a Shopify project take?",
      "shopify5A": "A custom Shopify theme takes 3-4 weeks. A headless Shopify build with Hydrogen takes 5-8 weeks. Migration from WooCommerce or Magento adds 1-2 weeks for data transfer and SEO redirect mapping.",
      "headlessWp1Q": "What is headless WordPress?",
      "headlessWp1A": "Headless WordPress uses WordPress as a content management system (backend) while a separate React/Next.js application handles the frontend. Content is delivered via API, resulting in 3-5x faster page loads than traditional WordPress.",
      "headlessWp2Q": "Who should consider headless WordPress?",
      "headlessWp2A": "Businesses already using WordPress who want modern performance without retraining content editors. Also ideal for content-heavy sites (blogs, news, magazines) where editorial workflow matters as much as frontend speed.",
      "headlessWp3Q": "Do WordPress plugins still work with headless setup?",
      "headlessWp3A": "Backend plugins (ACF, Yoast SEO, WPML, WooCommerce) continue working normally. Frontend-only plugins (sliders, page builders) are replaced by custom React components that perform significantly better.",
      "headlessWp4Q": "Is headless WordPress more expensive?",
      "headlessWp4A": "The initial build costs 20-30% more due to the dual architecture. However, the long-term savings from better performance (lower hosting costs), fewer security issues, and easier maintenance often offset the upfront investment within 12 months.",
      "headlessWp5Q": "How does DMC Kreatif connect WordPress to React?",
      "headlessWp5A": "We use WPGraphQL for efficient data fetching with Next.js. Custom post types, ACF fields, and taxonomies are all exposed via the GraphQL API. Incremental Static Regeneration ensures content updates appear within seconds.",
      "postgresql1Q": "Why PostgreSQL instead of MySQL or MongoDB?",
      "postgresql1A": "PostgreSQL offers JSONB for flexible data, Row-Level Security for GDPR compliance, full-text search without Elasticsearch, and advanced features (CTEs, window functions) that MySQL lacks. It's the most capable open-source database.",
      "postgresql2Q": "Is PostgreSQL suitable for small business websites?",
      "postgresql2A": "Absolutely. PostgreSQL runs on Supabase's free tier (500MB), which handles thousands of users easily. As your business grows, PostgreSQL scales seamlessly to millions of rows without architecture changes.",
      "postgresql3Q": "How does PostgreSQL help with GDPR?",
      "postgresql3A": "Row-Level Security (RLS) enforces data access rules at the database level — users can only access their own data, even if application code has vulnerabilities. Combined with EU-hosted Supabase, your data stays GDPR compliant.",
      "postgresql4Q": "Can PostgreSQL handle JSON data like MongoDB?",
      "postgresql4A": "Yes. PostgreSQL's JSONB type stores, queries, and indexes JSON data efficiently. Unlike MongoDB, you get JSON flexibility with SQL joins, ACID transactions, and relational integrity in a single database.",
      "postgresql5Q": "What PostgreSQL extensions does DMC Kreatif use?",
      "postgresql5A": "We commonly use pgvector for AI embeddings, PostGIS for geospatial data, pg_trgm for fuzzy search, and uuid-ossp for unique identifiers. Supabase makes enabling extensions a single click.",
      "nodejs1Q": "Why Node.js for backend development?",
      "nodejs1A": "Node.js uses JavaScript on the server, enabling full-stack development with a single language. Its event-driven architecture handles thousands of concurrent connections efficiently, making it ideal for real-time APIs and microservices.",
      "nodejs2Q": "Is Node.js fast enough for production applications?",
      "nodejs2A": "Yes. Node.js runs on Chrome's V8 engine, compiling JavaScript to machine code. Companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, and PayPal use Node.js for their production backends, handling millions of requests per day.",
      "nodejs3Q": "What Node.js frameworks does DMC Kreatif use?",
      "nodejs3A": "For API development, we use Express.js and Fastify. For serverless functions, we use Vercel Functions and Supabase Edge Functions (Deno). For full-stack applications, Next.js API routes handle backend logic seamlessly.",
      "nodejs4Q": "Can Node.js handle e-commerce backend requirements?",
      "nodejs4A": "Absolutely. Node.js powers Shopify's backend, handles payment processing via Stripe SDKs, manages inventory systems, and processes thousands of concurrent orders. Its non-blocking I/O is perfect for high-traffic stores.",
      "nodejs5Q": "How does Node.js compare to PHP for web development?",
      "nodejs5A": "Node.js offers better performance for I/O-intensive tasks, a unified JavaScript stack, modern async/await patterns, and a faster-growing ecosystem. PHP remains viable for WordPress, but Node.js is the modern choice for new projects."
