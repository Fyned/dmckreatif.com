      "description": "We design and build bespoke websites that turn visitors into customers. Every project starts with a deep-dive into your brand, audience and business goals so the final product reflects who you are — not a generic template. Our development stack centres on React, Next.js and Vite, giving you server-side rendering for SEO, instant page transitions and code-splitting that keeps initial load times under 1.5 seconds. Each site is fully responsive from mobile to ultra-wide, scores 95+ on Google Lighthouse across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO, and ships with structured data markup so search engines understand your content from day one. We wire up contact forms, analytics dashboards and CRM integrations, then hand you a live staging link for weekly review. After launch you receive 30 days of priority support, full source-code ownership and documentation so your team — or any developer — can maintain the site independently. Whether you need a single landing page or a multi-language corporate presence across France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, we deliver on time and on budget.",

From product catalogue to checkout confirmation, every step is optimised for conversion: fast-loading product pages, intuitive filtering, one-click add-to-cart and a streamlined checkout flow that supports credit cards, iDEAL, Bancontact, SEPA and more via Stripe. Inventory syncs in real time, multi-currency pricing adjusts automatically and tax rules comply with EU VAT regulations out of the box. The admin panel lets you manage products, track orders, apply discount codes and generate sales reports without touching code. We integrate shipping calculators, abandoned-cart recovery emails and review systems that build social proof. On the technical side, product pages are pre-rendered for instant Google indexing, structured data powers rich search results and image optimisation keeps page weight low. Every store is fully responsive, supports four languages by default and includes 30 days of post-launch support plus staff training on the admin dashboard. The result: a store that loads fast, ranks well, and converts browsers into buyers.",

We fix every issue that blocks search engines from understanding your site, then move into keyword research tailored to your market — whether that is Paris, London, Brussels or Amsterdam. On-page optimisation covers meta titles, descriptions, heading hierarchy, image alt text and schema markup for rich results. We set up Google Search Console and Analytics 4 so you can track impressions, clicks, rankings and conversions in real time. For ongoing clients we deliver monthly performance reports with clear action items: new content recommendations, backlink opportunities and competitor gap analysis. Our approach is data-driven and transparent — no black-hat tricks, no vanity metrics, just measurable organic growth. Clients typically see a 40-120 % increase in organic traffic within the first six months. Whether you need a one-time audit or continuous optimisation, we tailor the scope to your budget and goals.",
