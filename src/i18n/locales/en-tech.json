      "react1A": "React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM make it the ideal choice for building fast, scalable web applications. With 220K+ GitHub stars and millions of developers, React ensures long-term maintainability and access to the largest ecosystem of UI libraries.",
      "react2Q": "Is React suitable for SEO-heavy websites?",
      "react2A": "Yes — when paired with Next.js for server-side rendering. We use React with Next.js for SEO-critical projects, ensuring search engines can crawl and index all content while maintaining React's interactive capabilities.",
      "react3Q": "How long does it take to build a React website?",
      "react3A": "A typical React website takes 2-4 weeks depending on complexity. Simple landing pages can be delivered in under a week, while full-featured applications with authentication and dashboards take 4-8 weeks.",
      "react4Q": "Can you migrate my existing website to React?",
      "react4A": "Absolutely. We specialise in migrating websites from WordPress, jQuery, and legacy frameworks to modern React. Our phased migration approach ensures zero downtime and preserves your existing SEO rankings.",
      "react5Q": "What is the cost of a React development project?",
      "react5A": "React projects start from €497 for single-page applications. Multi-page sites with advanced features range from €997-€2,997. Contact us for a free consultation and custom quote tailored to your requirements.",
      "nextjs1Q": "When should I choose Next.js over plain React?",
      "nextjs1A": "Choose Next.js when SEO is critical, when you need server-side rendering, or when building a multilingual site. For pure single-page apps or client dashboards where SEO doesn't matter, Vite + React is faster and lighter.",
      "nextjs2Q": "Does Next.js improve SEO compared to React?",
      "nextjs2A": "Yes, significantly. Next.js's server-side rendering sends fully rendered HTML to search engines, while client-side React sends empty HTML. This leads to faster indexing, better rankings, and improved Core Web Vitals scores.",
      "nextjs3Q": "Can Next.js handle multilingual websites?",
      "nextjs3A": "Next.js has built-in i18n routing that makes multilingual sites straightforward. We configure locale detection, URL prefixes (en, fr, nl, de), and alternate hreflang tags automatically for all European markets.",
      "nextjs4Q": "What hosting does DMC Kreatif use for Next.js?",
      "nextjs4A": "We deploy Next.js applications on Vercel, the platform built by the Next.js creators. This ensures optimal performance, automatic CI/CD, and a global edge network with 100+ points of presence across Europe.",
      "nextjs5Q": "How does Next.js compare to WordPress for business websites?",
      "nextjs5A": "Next.js delivers 3-5x faster page loads, perfect Lighthouse scores, and built-in security — no plugins, updates, or hack vulnerabilities. For businesses that need a CMS, we pair Next.js with headless WordPress for the best of both worlds.",
      "typescript1Q": "Why do you use TypeScript instead of JavaScript?",
      "typescript1A": "TypeScript catches 15-20% of bugs at compile time that would otherwise reach production. It makes code self-documenting, enables powerful IDE autocomplete, and is now the industry standard used by 78% of professional JavaScript developers.",
      "typescript2Q": "Does TypeScript slow down development?",
      "typescript2A": "Initially there's a small overhead, but TypeScript pays for itself quickly. Fewer bugs mean less debugging time, better autocomplete means faster coding, and explicit types mean faster onboarding for new team members.",
      "typescript3Q": "Can TypeScript work with my existing JavaScript code?",
      "typescript3A": "Yes — TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so all valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript. We can migrate incrementally, adding types file by file, with zero disruption to your existing application.",
      "typescript4Q": "Is TypeScript required for React projects?",
      "typescript4A": "Not technically required, but strongly recommended. TypeScript prevents entire categories of runtime errors, makes React prop types explicit, and is supported out of the box by Create React App, Vite, and Next.js.",
      "typescript5Q": "What TypeScript configuration does DMC Kreatif use?",
      "typescript5A": "We use strict mode with all checks enabled: strictNullChecks, noImplicitAny, noUncheckedIndexedAccess, and exactOptionalPropertyTypes. This catches the maximum number of bugs at compile time.",
      "vite1Q": "Why does DMC Kreatif use Vite instead of Webpack?",
      "vite1A": "Vite's native ES module development server starts instantly regardless of project size, while Webpack can take 30+ seconds. HMR updates in under 50ms versus Webpack's 1-2 seconds. For production, Vite produces smaller bundles via Rollup.",
      "vite2Q": "Is Vite production-ready for enterprise projects?",
      "vite2A": "Absolutely. Vite is used by Shopify, Google, Apple, and thousands of production applications. With Rollup under the hood for production builds, it produces highly optimised, battle-tested output.",
      "vite3Q": "Can I migrate from Webpack to Vite?",
      "vite3A": "Yes — most Webpack projects can migrate to Vite within a few hours. Vite supports most Webpack loader equivalents through its plugin system, and we handle the migration as part of our modernisation service.",
      "vite4Q": "Does Vite work with TypeScript and React?",
      "vite4A": "Vite has first-class TypeScript and React support with zero configuration. Simply create a .tsx file and it works. Vite uses esbuild for TypeScript transpilation, making it 20-30x faster than the TypeScript compiler.",
      "vite5Q": "What is the difference between Vite and Next.js?",
      "vite5A": "Vite is a build tool for client-side applications, while Next.js is a full-stack framework with SSR. Use Vite for SPAs, dashboards, and internal tools. Use Next.js when you need SEO, server-side rendering, or API routes.",
      "tailwindcss1Q": "Why Tailwind CSS instead of Bootstrap or custom CSS?",
      "tailwindcss1A": "Tailwind's utility-first approach produces 80-95% smaller CSS bundles than Bootstrap. Unlike custom CSS, Tailwind enforces consistency through design tokens and eliminates naming conflicts. Every site looks unique, not like a Bootstrap template.",
      "tailwindcss2Q": "Does Tailwind CSS affect website performance?",
      "tailwindcss2A": "Tailwind actually improves performance. The JIT compiler generates only the CSS classes you use, resulting in production stylesheets under 10KB. Compare this to Bootstrap's 150KB+ or typical custom CSS of 50-200KB.",
      "tailwindcss3Q": "Can Tailwind CSS create unique, branded designs?",
      "tailwindcss3A": "Absolutely. Our neo-brutalist design system is built entirely with Tailwind CSS. Custom colours, typography, spacing, and animations are defined in the config, ensuring every site has a unique brand identity — not a generic template look.",
      "tailwindcss4Q": "Is Tailwind CSS harder to maintain than regular CSS?",
      "tailwindcss4A": "It's actually easier. With Tailwind, styles are co-located with components, so you never hunt for CSS files. Refactoring is safer because styles are scoped. And the design token system prevents colour and spacing drift over time.",
      "tailwindcss5Q": "Does DMC Kreatif use Tailwind CSS v4?",
      "tailwindcss5A": "Yes, we use Tailwind CSS v4 which introduced a new CSS-first configuration, the Oxide engine for faster builds, and automatic content detection. This means even faster build times and a simpler developer experience.",
      "framerMotion1Q": "Why use Framer Motion instead of CSS animations?",
      "framerMotion1A": "CSS animations can't handle exit animations, layout changes, or gesture-driven interactions. Framer Motion's declarative API makes complex animation sequences simple while maintaining 60fps performance through hardware acceleration.",
      "framerMotion2Q": "Do animations slow down website performance?",
      "framerMotion2A": "Not when done correctly. Framer Motion uses GPU-accelerated transforms by default, keeping animations off the main thread. Our animation system is optimised for Core Web Vitals — all animations use will-change and composite-only properties.",
      "framerMotion3Q": "What types of animations does DMC Kreatif implement?",
      "framerMotion3A": "Scroll-triggered reveals, page transitions, hover micro-interactions, staggered list animations, counter animations for statistics, parallax effects, and gesture-driven interfaces. Every animation serves a purpose in the UX.",
      "framerMotion4Q": "Can animations be disabled for accessibility?",
      "framerMotion4A": "Yes. We implement the prefers-reduced-motion media query across all projects. Users who prefer reduced motion see instant state changes instead of animations, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.",
      "framerMotion5Q": "Is Framer Motion included in all DMC Kreatif projects?",
      "framerMotion5A": "Framer Motion is part of our standard stack for all React projects. It's lightweight (just 32KB gzipped), tree-shakeable, and provides the animation capabilities needed for our premium, agency-quality user experiences.",
      "supabase1Q": "Why does DMC Kreatif choose Supabase over Firebase?",
      "supabase1A": "Supabase uses PostgreSQL (not NoSQL), supports EU hosting for GDPR compliance, offers Row-Level Security, has no vendor lock-in, and provides a more generous free tier. For European businesses, it's the superior choice.",
      "supabase2Q": "Is Supabase GDPR compliant?",
      "supabase2A": "Yes. Supabase offers EU region hosting (Frankfurt, Ireland), Row-Level Security for data isolation, and full data export capabilities. Combined with our GDPR-compliant implementations, your data stays in Europe.",
      "supabase3Q": "What can Supabase do for my web application?",
      "supabase3A": "Authentication (email, Google, social logins), real-time data synchronisation, file storage with CDN, serverless edge functions, auto-generated APIs, and PostgreSQL database — all from a single platform.",
      "supabase4Q": "How much does Supabase cost?",
      "supabase4A": "Supabase has a generous free tier (50K monthly active users, 500MB database, 1GB storage). The Pro plan at $25/month covers most business needs. Compare this to Firebase's unpredictable usage-based pricing.",
      "supabase5Q": "Can Supabase handle e-commerce backends?",
      "supabase5A": "Yes. We use Supabase for custom e-commerce with product catalogues, user accounts, order management, and payment processing via Stripe/LemonSqueezy integration. Row-Level Security ensures secure multi-tenant data access.",
      "vercel1Q": "Why does DMC Kreatif deploy on Vercel?",
      "vercel1A": "Vercel is created by the Next.js team, ensuring optimal framework support. Its global edge network, automatic CI/CD, preview deployments, and Web Vitals analytics make it the best platform for React and Next.js applications.",
      "vercel2Q": "How fast are websites hosted on Vercel?",
      "vercel2A": "Vercel's edge network has 100+ points of presence worldwide. Static assets load in under 50ms, and server-rendered pages in under 200ms. Our Vercel-deployed sites consistently achieve sub-1-second Largest Contentful Paint.",
      "vercel3Q": "Is Vercel suitable for business-critical websites?",
      "vercel3A": "Vercel provides 99.99% uptime SLA on Enterprise plans, DDoS protection, automatic HTTPS, and instant rollbacks. Clients include GitHub, McDonald's, and The Washington Post — it's battle-tested at any scale.",
      "vercel4Q": "How does Vercel handle deployments?",
      "vercel4A": "Push to Git and Vercel automatically builds, tests, and deploys. Every branch gets a unique preview URL for stakeholder review. Production deploys are atomic — if a build fails, the previous version stays live.",
      "vercel5Q": "What is the cost of hosting on Vercel?",
      "vercel5A": "Vercel's Hobby plan is free for personal projects. The Pro plan ($20/month) covers most business sites with unlimited bandwidth and 100GB. Enterprise plans include SLAs, priority support, and advanced analytics.",
      "shopify1Q": "Why choose Shopify for European e-commerce?",
      "shopify1A": "Shopify supports multi-currency checkout, EU payment gateways (iDEAL, Bancontact, Klarna), VAT handling, and GDPR-compliant data processing. Its 99.99% uptime and PCI compliance eliminate server management entirely.",
      "shopify2Q": "Can DMC Kreatif build custom Shopify themes?",
      "shopify2A": "Yes. We build both custom Liquid themes for traditional Shopify and Hydrogen-powered headless storefronts with React. Custom themes ensure your store has a unique brand identity, not a generic template look.",
      "shopify3Q": "How does headless Shopify work?",
      "shopify3A": "Headless Shopify uses the Storefront API to power a custom React frontend while Shopify handles the backend: checkout, payments, inventory, and orders. You get Shopify's reliability with our premium frontend experience.",
      "shopify4Q": "What Shopify apps does DMC Kreatif recommend?",
      "shopify4A": "We typically integrate Klaviyo (email marketing), Yotpo (reviews), ShipStation (shipping), and Privy (popups). For EU-specific needs: Mollie Payments, Sendcloud, and GDPR compliance apps.",
      "shopify5Q": "How long does a Shopify project take?",
      "shopify5A": "A custom Shopify theme takes 3-4 weeks. A headless Shopify build with Hydrogen takes 5-8 weeks. Migration from WooCommerce or Magento adds 1-2 weeks for data transfer and SEO redirect mapping.",
      "headlessWp1Q": "What is headless WordPress?",
      "headlessWp1A": "Headless WordPress uses WordPress as a content management system (backend) while a separate React/Next.js application handles the frontend. Content is delivered via API, resulting in 3-5x faster page loads than traditional WordPress.",
      "headlessWp2Q": "Who should consider headless WordPress?",
      "headlessWp2A": "Businesses already using WordPress who want modern performance without retraining content editors. Also ideal for content-heavy sites (blogs, news, magazines) where editorial workflow matters as much as frontend speed.",
      "headlessWp3Q": "Do WordPress plugins still work with headless setup?",
      "headlessWp3A": "Backend plugins (ACF, Yoast SEO, WPML, WooCommerce) continue working normally. Frontend-only plugins (sliders, page builders) are replaced by custom React components that perform significantly better.",
      "headlessWp4Q": "Is headless WordPress more expensive?",
      "headlessWp4A": "The initial build costs 20-30% more due to the dual architecture. However, the long-term savings from better performance (lower hosting costs), fewer security issues, and easier maintenance often offset the upfront investment within 12 months.",
      "headlessWp5Q": "How does DMC Kreatif connect WordPress to React?",
      "headlessWp5A": "We use WPGraphQL for efficient data fetching with Next.js. Custom post types, ACF fields, and taxonomies are all exposed via the GraphQL API. Incremental Static Regeneration ensures content updates appear within seconds.",
      "postgresql1Q": "Why PostgreSQL instead of MySQL or MongoDB?",
      "postgresql1A": "PostgreSQL offers JSONB for flexible data, Row-Level Security for GDPR compliance, full-text search without Elasticsearch, and advanced features (CTEs, window functions) that MySQL lacks. It's the most capable open-source database.",
      "postgresql2Q": "Is PostgreSQL suitable for small business websites?",
      "postgresql2A": "Absolutely. PostgreSQL runs on Supabase's free tier (500MB), which handles thousands of users easily. As your business grows, PostgreSQL scales seamlessly to millions of rows without architecture changes.",
      "postgresql3Q": "How does PostgreSQL help with GDPR?",
      "postgresql3A": "Row-Level Security (RLS) enforces data access rules at the database level — users can only access their own data, even if application code has vulnerabilities. Combined with EU-hosted Supabase, your data stays GDPR compliant.",
      "postgresql4Q": "Can PostgreSQL handle JSON data like MongoDB?",
      "postgresql4A": "Yes. PostgreSQL's JSONB type stores, queries, and indexes JSON data efficiently. Unlike MongoDB, you get JSON flexibility with SQL joins, ACID transactions, and relational integrity in a single database.",
      "postgresql5Q": "What PostgreSQL extensions does DMC Kreatif use?",
      "postgresql5A": "We commonly use pgvector for AI embeddings, PostGIS for geospatial data, pg_trgm for fuzzy search, and uuid-ossp for unique identifiers. Supabase makes enabling extensions a single click.",
      "nodejs1Q": "Why Node.js for backend development?",
      "nodejs1A": "Node.js uses JavaScript on the server, enabling full-stack development with a single language. Its event-driven architecture handles thousands of concurrent connections efficiently, making it ideal for real-time APIs and microservices.",
      "nodejs2Q": "Is Node.js fast enough for production applications?",
      "nodejs2A": "Yes. Node.js runs on Chrome's V8 engine, compiling JavaScript to machine code. Companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, and PayPal use Node.js for their production backends, handling millions of requests per day.",
      "nodejs3Q": "What Node.js frameworks does DMC Kreatif use?",
      "nodejs3A": "For API development, we use Express.js and Fastify. For serverless functions, we use Vercel Functions and Supabase Edge Functions (Deno). For full-stack applications, Next.js API routes handle backend logic seamlessly.",
      "nodejs4Q": "Can Node.js handle e-commerce backend requirements?",
      "nodejs4A": "Absolutely. Node.js powers Shopify's backend, handles payment processing via Stripe SDKs, manages inventory systems, and processes thousands of concurrent orders. Its non-blocking I/O is perfect for high-traffic stores.",
      "nodejs5Q": "How does Node.js compare to PHP for web development?",
      "nodejs5A": "Node.js offers better performance for I/O-intensive tasks, a unified JavaScript stack, modern async/await patterns, and a faster-growing ecosystem. PHP remains viable for WordPress, but Node.js is the modern choice for new projects."
