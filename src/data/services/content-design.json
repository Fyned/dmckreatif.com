      "desc": "Research-driven user experience and interface design for web and mobile applications across European markets. We combine behavioural insights, structured user research and pixel-perfect visual craft to create digital products that convert visitors into loyal customers.",
      "longDesc": "Great digital products begin with a deep understanding of the people who use them. Our UX/UI practice starts every engagement with structured user research -- stakeholder interviews, competitive audits, persona mapping and journey analysis -- so design decisions are grounded in evidence rather than assumptions. For European projects we layer in cultural and linguistic considerations that global agencies routinely overlook, from right-to-left numeral formatting in financial dashboards to GDPR-compliant onboarding flows.\n\nFrom research we move into information architecture and wireframing inside Figma, producing low-fidelity layouts that let stakeholders validate navigation, content hierarchy and task flows before a single pixel of visual design is created. This phase saves weeks of downstream rework and keeps budgets predictable. Every wireframe is annotated with interaction notes, error states and accessibility requirements so nothing is left to interpretation during development.\n\nVisual design is where brand personality meets usability science. We apply your colour system, typography scale and motion language across every screen, ensuring WCAG 2.2 AA contrast ratios, touch-target compliance and consistent spacing tokens. High-fidelity prototypes in Figma are fully interactive -- complete with micro-animations, hover states and responsive breakpoints -- giving you a realistic preview of the finished product before a line of code is written.\n\nHandoff to engineering is seamless. We deliver a structured Figma file with auto-layout, design tokens exported to JSON, a component inventory and a redline specification document. Post-launch, we conduct usability testing sessions with real users, analyse heatmaps and session recordings, and feed insights back into iterative design sprints so your product improves continuously.",

      "longDesc": "A website without a strategy is a brochure. Our digital strategy service gives European SMEs a clear, prioritised roadmap that connects business goals to technology decisions, channel investments and content initiatives. We start with a thorough audit of your current digital footprint -- website analytics, search visibility, social presence, paid media performance and CRM maturity -- then benchmark you against three to five direct competitors in your market.\n\nFrom the audit we build a gap analysis that quantifies where revenue is being left on the table. For a Belgian construction firm that might mean discovering that 40 percent of traffic arrives on mobile yet the quote-request form is desktop-only. For a French SaaS startup it might reveal that branded search volume is strong but category keywords are completely uncontested. Every finding is ranked by effort versus impact so you know exactly where to invest first.\n\nThe strategy document itself is a living artefact, not a static PDF. It includes a twelve-month phased roadmap with quarterly milestones, KPI targets, technology recommendations (CMS, analytics stack, CRM, marketing automation) and a content calendar aligned to buyer-journey stages. We specify build-vs-buy decisions, estimate budgets and identify integration points between platforms so nothing is siloed.\n\nExecution support is where we differ from traditional consultancies. We stay engaged through monthly strategy reviews, adjusting priorities based on real performance data. If a paid channel underperforms, we reallocate budget. If organic traffic spikes on an unexpected keyword cluster, we accelerate content production. Strategy is not a one-time deliverable -- it is an ongoing discipline we embed into your operations.",

      "longDesc": "Your brand identity is the first promise you make to every prospect. In competitive European markets -- where French consumers value elegance, German buyers prioritise precision and British clients expect understated confidence -- a generic visual identity is a liability. Our brand identity service creates a cohesive system of visual and verbal elements that positions your business as the premium choice in your category.\n\nThe process begins with a brand strategy workshop where we define your positioning, audience archetypes, tone of voice and competitive differentiation. We analyse visual trends within your industry and across adjacent sectors, identifying opportunities to stand apart rather than blend in. From this foundation we develop three distinct creative directions, each presented as a mood board with logo concepts, colour palettes, typography pairings and sample applications.\n\nOnce a direction is selected, we refine the logo through multiple rounds of iteration, testing it at every scale from favicon to billboard. The colour system is built with accessibility in mind -- every combination meets WCAG AA contrast minimums. Typography selections include web-safe fallbacks and variable font options for performance. We create a comprehensive set of brand assets: primary and secondary logos, icon variations, patterns, illustration style guides and photography direction.\n\nThe final deliverable is a brand guidelines document -- typically forty to sixty pages -- that ensures consistency across every touchpoint. It covers logo usage rules, colour specifications (HEX, RGB, CMYK, Pantone), typography hierarchy, spacing systems, do-and-don't examples and templates for common applications like business cards, email signatures and social media profiles.

      "longDesc": "As digital products grow, inconsistency creeps in. Buttons appear in four different sizes, spacing varies between pages, and every new feature introduces a slightly different card pattern. A design system eliminates this entropy by establishing a single source of truth -- a shared library of reusable components, design tokens and usage guidelines that every designer and developer references.\n\nWe build design systems in Figma using auto-layout, component variants and design tokens that map directly to CSS custom properties or Tailwind configuration. Atomic design principles structure the library from primitives (colours, typography, spacing, elevation) through atoms (buttons, inputs, badges) to molecules (cards, navigation bars, form groups) and organisms (page headers, data tables, modal dialogs). Every component includes all states: default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading and error.\n\nDocumentation lives in Storybook, where each component is rendered in isolation with interactive controls, accessibility annotations and code snippets. Developers can inspect props, test edge cases and copy implementation patterns without leaving the browser. We configure visual regression testing with Chromatic so that unintended UI changes are caught in pull requests before they reach production.\n\nAdoption is the hardest part, so we invest in governance. We run onboarding sessions for design and engineering teams, establish contribution guidelines, create a Slack channel for system questions and schedule quarterly audits to prune unused components and add new patterns. The result is faster feature delivery, fewer design reviews and a product that feels cohesive no matter how many teams are building on it.",

      "longDesc": "Building the wrong thing is the most expensive mistake in software development. Rapid prototyping eliminates that risk by putting a realistic, interactive version of your product in front of real users within days rather than months. Our prototyping practice is designed for speed without sacrificing fidelity -- stakeholders see something that looks and feels like the final product, while behind the scenes every screen is a Figma frame that can be changed in minutes.\n\nWe begin with a concept sprint -- a structured two-day workshop where we map user journeys, sketch solutions on paper, and converge on a single direction. From there we build an interactive Figma prototype that includes realistic content, micro-interactions, conditional logic and responsive behaviour. Navigation feels real, forms validate inputs, and transitions match the intended motion language. This is not a clickable wireframe; it is an experience.\n\nUser testing is built into the process. We recruit five to eight participants from your target audience and run moderated testing sessions, either remote via Maze or in-person at our London studio. Each session is recorded with consent, timestamped with key observations, and synthesised into an insight report that highlights usability issues, feature priorities and unexpected user behaviours. Test findings drive the next iteration.\n\nThe final deliverable is a validated, developer-ready prototype with a companion specification document. It includes screen flows, interaction annotations, asset exports and a prioritised backlog of features ranked by user-testing evidence. Development teams receive a clear picture of what to build, in what order, and why -- dramatically reducing scope creep and mid-sprint design changes.",

      "longDesc": "Over sixty percent of European web traffic now comes from mobile devices, yet most agencies still design on desktop and retrofit for smaller screens. Mobile-first design inverts that approach -- we begin with the constraints of a 375-pixel viewport and progressively enhance for tablet and desktop. The result is faster load times, cleaner information hierarchy and interfaces that feel native on the devices your customers actually use.\n\nOur mobile-first process starts with content prioritisation. On a small screen, every element must earn its place. We work with your team to rank content blocks by user intent, strip away decorative clutter and establish a vertical rhythm that guides the thumb naturally from headline to call-to-action. Touch targets meet the 44-pixel minimum recommended by Apple and Google. Gesture interactions -- swipe to dismiss, pull to refresh, long-press for context menus -- are designed to feel intuitive without conflicting with browser-native behaviours.\n\nResponsive implementation goes far beyond fluid grids and media queries. We define a breakpoint strategy based on your actual analytics data, not arbitrary device widths. Container queries allow components to adapt to their parent context rather than the viewport alone. Images are served through responsive srcset with WebP and AVIF formats, lazy-loaded below the fold and sized to prevent cumulative layout shift. Typography scales fluidly using CSS clamp functions rather than stepped breakpoints.\n\nPerformance is the ultimate design decision on mobile. We target sub-two-second Largest Contentful Paint on 4G connections, keep Total Blocking Time under 150 milliseconds and ensure Cumulative Layout Shift stays below 0.05. Every design choice -- animation complexity, font loading strategy, image format, JavaScript bundle size -- is evaluated against Core Web Vitals impact.

      "longDesc": "Content marketing in Europe demands more than translated blog posts. Each market has distinct content consumption habits, search behaviours and platform preferences. French decision-makers engage deeply with long-form thought leadership on LinkedIn. German buyers expect technical whitepapers backed by data. British audiences respond to conversational case studies with measurable outcomes. Our content marketing service accounts for these nuances from strategy through production to distribution.\n\nWe begin with keyword and topic research using Ahrefs, Semrush and Google Search Console data to identify content gaps your competitors have not filled. The resulting editorial calendar maps topics to buyer-journey stages -- awareness articles that capture top-of-funnel search volume, consideration pieces that address objections and comparison queries, and decision content that drives demo requests or quote submissions. Every piece is briefed with target keyword, search intent, word count, internal linking strategy and call-to-action.\n\nProduction spans multiple formats. Long-form blog articles are written by native-language specialists, reviewed for SEO optimisation and published with structured data markup for rich snippets. Case studies follow a problem-approach-result framework with quantified outcomes. Whitepapers are designed as gated PDF assets that feed your email nurture sequences. Social media content is adapted per platform -- LinkedIn carousels, Twitter threads, Instagram reels -- with copy and visuals tailored to each channel's algorithm and audience expectations.\n\nVideo production rounds out the content mix. We produce fifteen to thirty-second social ads, sixty-second explainer videos, customer testimonial clips and behind-the-scenes brand films. All video is shot or animated in-house, colour-graded to match your brand palette, subtitled in multiple languages and optimised for each platform's aspect ratio and compression requirements.

    "digitalStrategy1A": "A full engagement includes a digital audit, competitive benchmarking, gap analysis, twelve-month phased roadmap, technology recommendations, content calendar and monthly strategy reviews. Deliverables are presented in a living document that evolves with your business.",
    "digitalStrategy2Q": "How is digital strategy different from a marketing plan?",
    "digitalStrategy2A": "Marketing plans focus on campaigns and channels. Digital strategy encompasses your entire online presence -- technology stack, data architecture, user experience, content systems and organisational capabilities. It provides the foundation that makes individual marketing campaigns more effective.",
    "digitalStrategy3Q": "Do you help with implementation or just deliver a document?",
    "digitalStrategy3A": "We stay engaged through implementation. Monthly strategy reviews track progress against KPIs, and we adjust priorities based on real performance data. If you need execution support, our design and development teams can implement roadmap initiatives directly.",
    "digitalStrategy4Q": "How do you account for different European markets?",
    "digitalStrategy4A": "Each market receives tailored analysis. Search behaviour differs significantly between France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. We research local competitors, platform preferences and regulatory requirements like GDPR nuances to ensure the strategy fits each target market.",

    "brandIdentity1Q": "What is included in a brand identity package?",
    "brandIdentity1A": "The complete package includes brand strategy workshop, three creative directions, final logo suite with all variations, colour system, typography selection, pattern library, photography direction and a forty to sixty page brand guidelines document with production-ready assets.",
    "brandIdentity2Q": "How many logo concepts will we see?",
    "brandIdentity2A": "We present three distinct creative directions, each with a logo concept, colour palette and typography pairing. Once a direction is selected, we refine through two to three revision rounds. This structured approach avoids endless iteration while ensuring you have genuine choice.",
    "brandIdentity3Q": "Can you design a brand identity for multilingual European markets?",
    "brandIdentity3A": "Absolutely. We test every visual element across Latin, Germanic and Romance language groups. Logo lockups are designed to accommodate varying name lengths, typography selections include full European character sets, and colour associations are validated against cultural norms in each target market.",
    "brandIdentity4Q": "What file formats do we receive?",
    "brandIdentity4A": "All assets are delivered in SVG for web, PNG with transparency for digital use, PDF for print, EPS for legacy systems, and CMYK variants for offset printing. Design tokens are exported as JSON for direct integration into your development workflow.",

    "designSystems1Q": "When does a company need a design system?",
    "designSystems1A": "A design system becomes valuable when multiple designers or developers work on the same product, when visual inconsistencies appear across pages, or when new features take longer to build because every component is created from scratch. Typically, products with twenty-plus screens benefit significantly.",
    "designSystems2Q": "Which tools do you use to build design systems?",
    "designSystems2A": "We build the design library in Figma with auto-layout and variants, document components in Storybook with interactive controls, and configure visual regression testing with Chromatic. Design tokens are exported as JSON and integrated with Tailwind CSS or styled-components.",
    "designSystems3Q": "How do you handle design system governance and updates?",
    "designSystems3A": "We establish contribution guidelines, a review process for new components, and quarterly audits to prune unused patterns. A dedicated Slack channel handles questions from designers and developers. This governance framework ensures the system evolves without becoming chaotic.",
    "designSystems4Q": "Can you integrate a design system with our existing codebase?",
    "designSystems4A": "Yes. We audit your existing components, map them to the new system, and create a migration plan that allows incremental adoption. Existing pages are updated gradually while new features use the system from day one, avoiding a disruptive big-bang rewrite.",

    "prototyping1Q": "How realistic are the prototypes you build?",
    "prototyping1A": "Our Figma prototypes include realistic content, micro-animations, conditional navigation logic and responsive behaviour. Stakeholders and test participants interact with something that looks and feels like a finished product, not a static wireframe with blue links.",
    "prototyping2Q": "How do you conduct user testing on prototypes?",
    "prototyping2A": "We recruit five to eight participants from your target audience and run moderated testing sessions, either remote via Maze or in-person at our London studio. Each session is recorded with consent and synthesised into an insight report with prioritised usability findings.",
    "prototyping3Q": "What happens after user testing reveals problems?",
    "prototyping3A": "We iterate. Test findings are categorised by severity, and critical issues are addressed in the next design sprint. The updated prototype is retested if needed. This cycle continues until key user flows achieve task-completion rates above eighty-five percent.",
    "prototyping4Q": "Can prototyping save money on development?",
    "prototyping4A": "Significantly. Fixing a usability issue in a Figma prototype takes minutes; fixing it in production code takes days. Our clients typically report thirty to fifty percent fewer mid-sprint design changes after validating with prototypes, which translates directly to lower development costs.",

    "mobileFirst1Q": "Why should we design mobile-first instead of desktop-first?",
    "mobileFirst1A": "Over sixty percent of European web traffic comes from mobile devices. Designing mobile-first forces content prioritisation, cleaner hierarchy and faster performance. Desktop enhancements are then added progressively, resulting in a better experience on every screen size.",
    "mobileFirst2Q": "How do you handle complex interfaces on small screens?",
    "mobileFirst2A": "We use progressive disclosure -- showing essential content first and revealing detail on demand through expandable sections, bottom sheets and contextual navigation. Complex data tables become swipeable cards. Multi-step forms are broken into focused single-field screens.",
    "mobileFirst3Q": "What performance targets do you aim for on mobile?",
    "mobileFirst3A": "We target sub-two-second Largest Contentful Paint on 4G connections, Total Blocking Time under 150 milliseconds and Cumulative Layout Shift below 0.05. These Core Web Vitals targets ensure fast loading, smooth interactivity and stable layouts on real devices.",
    "mobileFirst4Q": "Do you test on real devices or just browser emulators?",
    "mobileFirst4A": "Both. Initial development uses browser DevTools for rapid iteration, but final testing occurs on a physical device lab covering iOS Safari, Android Chrome, Samsung Internet and common viewport sizes. Network throttling simulates real 3G and 4G conditions in each target market.",

    "contentMarketing1Q": "How do you create content for multiple European languages?",
    "contentMarketing1A": "Each language is written by a native-speaking specialist, not machine-translated. Writers research local keyword volumes, cultural references and industry terminology. A senior editor reviews every piece for brand voice consistency before publication across all target markets.",
    "contentMarketing2Q": "What types of content do you produce?",
    "contentMarketing2A": "We produce long-form blog articles, case studies with quantified results, gated whitepapers, LinkedIn carousels, social media posts, email newsletter content and video assets from fifteen-second social ads to sixty-second explainer videos. Every format is tailored to its distribution channel.",
    "contentMarketing3Q": "How do you measure content marketing ROI?",
    "contentMarketing3A": "Every asset is tracked with UTM parameters and attributed to pipeline stages in your CRM. We measure organic traffic growth, keyword ranking improvements, lead-magnet conversion rates, email nurture engagement and influenced revenue. Quarterly reports connect content investment to business outcomes.",
    "contentMarketing4Q": "How long before we see results from content marketing?",
    "contentMarketing4A": "Social and email content generates engagement within weeks. SEO content typically takes three to six months to rank and drive consistent organic traffic. We set realistic expectations during strategy and provide monthly progress reports so you can track momentum from day one."
