const content = `<p>When European business owners plan a new website, the technology question comes up fast: <strong>should you go with WordPress or a modern JavaScript framework like React?</strong> Both have their place, but the right choice depends on your goals, budget, and long-term vision. This guide breaks down the real differences — not marketing hype — so you can make the smartest investment for your business.</p><h2>WordPress in 2026: Still Dominant, But Aging</h2><p>WordPress powers roughly <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">43% of all websites</a> globally. It is mature, has a massive plugin ecosystem, and nearly any web developer can work with it. For simple blogs and brochure sites, it still works. Its visual editor (Gutenberg) has improved, and the WooCommerce plugin powers millions of online stores.</p><p>However, WordPress faces growing challenges that directly affect your business:</p><ul><li><strong>Performance:</strong> WordPress sites rely on PHP rendering and MySQL queries. Page load times of 3-5 seconds are common without aggressive optimization. Google now penalizes slow sites in search rankings, and every additional second of load time reduces conversions by 7% according to Google research.</li><li><strong>Security:</strong> WordPress is the most targeted CMS for attacks. <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wordfence</a> reports that WordPress vulnerabilities increased 150% between 2023 and 2025. Plugins require constant updates, and a single outdated plugin can compromise your entire site, your customer data, and your reputation.</li><li><strong>Maintenance overhead:</strong> Theme updates, plugin conflicts, PHP version compatibility, and database bloat create ongoing work. Many business owners end up spending €100-300/month on WordPress maintenance — work that is largely unnecessary with modern frameworks.</li><li><strong>Mobile experience:</strong> Many WordPress themes are responsive in theory but feel sluggish on mobile devices due to heavy page weight (often 3-8 MB) and render-blocking resources. With over 60% of European web traffic coming from mobile, this is a critical weakness.</li><li><strong>Plugin dependency:</strong> WordPress's strength is also its weakness. You need plugins for almost everything: SEO, caching, security, forms, backups. Each plugin adds code weight, potential conflicts, and security risk. A typical business WordPress site runs 15-30 plugins.</li></ul><h2>React and Modern Frameworks: The New Standard</h2><p>React (by Meta), combined with frameworks like <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Vite</strong>, represents the current state of the art in web development. Companies like Stripe, Vercel, Linear, Shopify, and Netflix build their frontends with React. It is not experimental technology — it is the industry standard for performance-critical websites.</p><p>What makes React different for business websites:</p><ul><li><strong>Speed:</strong> React sites load in under 2 seconds because they use code splitting, lazy loading, and server-side rendering. Only the code needed for the current page is loaded. No bloated plugins, no unnecessary database queries. The result: pages that feel instant.</li><li><strong>SEO performance:</strong> With Next.js or server-side rendering, React sites get indexed by Google just as well as any WordPress site — often better, because of superior Core Web Vitals scores. Google has confirmed that page experience signals (speed, interactivity, visual stability) directly affect search rankings.</li><li><strong>Security:</strong> No plugins to hack, no database to inject, no admin panel to brute-force. React sites can be deployed as static files on a CDN, making them virtually unhackable. There is no server to compromise, no PHP vulnerabilities to exploit.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Whether you have 100 or 100,000 monthly visitors, a React site performs identically because it is pre-built and served from edge servers worldwide. WordPress sites often crash or slow dramatically during traffic spikes unless you invest in expensive hosting.</li><li><strong>Developer experience:</strong> React uses TypeScript for type safety, component-based architecture for reusability, and modern tooling for fast development. This means fewer bugs, faster iterations, and easier maintenance long-term.</li></ul><h2>Head-to-Head Comparison</h2><p>Here is how WordPress and React stack up for European SMBs across the metrics that matter most:</p><ul><li><strong>Initial cost:</strong> WordPress €500-2,000 vs. React €800-3,000. WordPress is cheaper upfront, but this gap has been narrowing as React tooling improves.</li><li><strong>Monthly maintenance:</strong> WordPress €100-300/month (hosting, plugin updates, security patches, backups) vs. React €20-100/month (hosting only, minimal maintenance). React is 60-80% cheaper to maintain.</li><li><strong>3-year total cost:</strong> WordPress €4,100-12,800 vs. React €1,520-6,600. React wins decisively on total cost of ownership. The initial savings of WordPress evaporate within the first year.</li><li><strong>Google Lighthouse score:</strong> WordPress 40-75 (typical, even with caching plugins) vs. React 90-100 (typical). React dramatically outperforms WordPress on the metrics Google uses to rank websites.</li><li><strong>Page load time:</strong> WordPress 3-5 seconds (average) vs. React 0.5-1.5 seconds (average). React is 3-5x faster. On mobile networks, this difference is even more pronounced.</li><li><strong>Security incidents:</strong> WordPress is targeted in 90%+ of CMS attacks. React static sites have near-zero attack surface. For businesses handling customer data under GDPR, this matters enormously.</li><li><strong>Content updates:</strong> WordPress has a built-in visual editor. React sites typically use a headless CMS or developer-managed content. WordPress wins here for non-technical users, though headless CMS solutions are closing the gap.</li></ul><h2>Real-World Performance: A Case Study</h2><p>We recently migrated a French construction company's website from WordPress to React (Vite + Tailwind CSS). The results were immediate and measurable:</p><ul><li>Google Lighthouse score went from 52 to 98</li><li>Page load time dropped from 4.2 seconds to 1.1 seconds</li><li>Mobile bounce rate decreased by 35%</li><li>Organic search traffic increased 45% within 3 months</li><li>Monthly maintenance cost dropped from €180 to €30</li></ul><p>These are not theoretical benefits. This is what happens when you replace a bloated WordPress site with clean, modern code. See more examples in our <a href="/en/portfolio">portfolio</a>.</p><h2>When WordPress Still Makes Sense</h2><p>To be fair, WordPress remains a valid choice in specific scenarios:</p><ul><li>You need to publish content daily and your team is already familiar with the WordPress editor and workflow.</li><li>You rely on specific WordPress plugins that have no React equivalent (though this is increasingly rare as the headless CMS ecosystem grows).</li><li>Your budget is under €500 and you need something live this week — WordPress.com or a simple theme can get you online fast.</li><li>You plan to manage the site entirely yourself with zero developer involvement and are comfortable with WordPress's learning curve.</li><li>You need WooCommerce specifically for its plugin ecosystem (though Shopify or custom React e-commerce often outperforms it).</li></ul><h2>When React Is the Better Choice</h2><p>For most European SMBs in 2026, React-based development is the stronger investment. Choose React if:</p><ul><li>You want your site to load fast and rank well on Google from day one — without ongoing SEO plugin management.</li><li>You serve customers in multiple European countries and need proper multilingual support with hreflang tags and localized URLs.</li><li>You care about design quality and want a unique brand experience, not a theme that hundreds of other businesses use.</li><li>You want low ongoing costs and minimal security worries — no more 3am panic about plugin vulnerabilities.</li><li>You are investing in your website as a long-term business asset that should last 3-5 years without a rebuild.</li><li>You value performance and understand that every second of load time costs you customers and revenue.</li></ul><p>At <a href="/en/services">DMC Kreatif</a>, we build exclusively with React, Next.js, and Vite. Every site we deliver scores 95+ on Google Lighthouse and loads in under 2 seconds.

Tools like Payload CMS, Strapi, or even WordPress in headless mode let your team edit content through a familiar interface while the frontend is built with React.</p><p>How headless works: your content is stored and edited in a CMS backend, but instead of WordPress generating the HTML pages, your React frontend fetches the content via API and renders it with lightning-fast performance. Your marketing team gets an easy editor. Your customers get a blazing-fast website. Everyone wins.</p><p>The trade-off is a slightly higher initial development cost (roughly 15-25% more than a standard React build) and the need for a developer to set up the connection between the CMS and the frontend. For businesses that update content frequently, this investment pays for itself within months.</p><h2>Making Your Decision</h2><p>Here is a simple decision framework:</p><ul><li><strong>Choose WordPress</strong> if you need the absolute cheapest option, plan to manage everything yourself, and accept slower performance and higher security risk.</li><li><strong>Choose React</strong> if you want professional quality, better SEO, lower long-term costs, and a website that performs like the best sites on the internet.</li><li><strong>Choose Headless</strong> if you want React's performance with a content editing experience your whole team can use.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>For European SMBs planning a new website in 2026, React-based development offers better performance, stronger SEO, lower long-term costs, and superior security compared to WordPress. The initial investment is higher, but the total cost of ownership over 3 years is typically 40-60% lower. More importantly, you get a website that actively helps your business grow rather than one you constantly fight to keep working.</p><p>Not sure which approach is right for your business? <a href="/en/contact">Book a free consultation</a> with DMC Kreatif.
