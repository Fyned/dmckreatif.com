const content = `<p>Choosing the right web agency is one of the most consequential decisions a European business can make. Your website is often the first touchpoint with potential customers, and the agency you partner with will shape that experience for years to come. With thousands of agencies across Europe — from solo freelancers to multinational firms — finding the right fit requires a structured approach rather than going with whichever agency responds first to your enquiry.</p>

<p>This guide walks you through the essential criteria for evaluating web agencies, with a specific focus on what matters for businesses operating in France, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany in 2026.</p>

<h2>1. Evaluate Their Portfolio — Quality Over Quantity</h2>

<p>The first thing to examine is an agency's portfolio, but do not just count projects — assess their quality rigorously. Look for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Design sophistication:</strong> Do their sites look modern, polished, and unique? Or do they rely on recognisable templates and generic Elementor/Divi layouts that you could buy for €59?</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Open their portfolio sites and run them through <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>. Scores below 80 suggest the agency does not prioritise performance — which directly affects your search rankings and conversion rates.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile experience:</strong> Browse their work on your phone. Is the mobile experience thoughtful and purposeful, or just a shrunken desktop version with tiny tap targets?</li>
<li><strong>Industry relevance:</strong> Have they built sites for businesses similar to yours? An agency experienced in <a href="/en/industries">your industry</a> understands your audience's expectations, your competitors' positioning, and the specific conversion patterns that work in your sector.</li>
<li><strong>Live, deployed projects:</strong> Can you visit actual working websites? Do links work? Do forms submit? Is the design consistent across screen sizes?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Red flag:</strong> If an agency cannot show you live, working websites — only static mockups, Behance screenshots, or Figma prototypes — proceed with caution. A <a href="/en/portfolio">real portfolio</a> of deployed, functioning projects is non-negotiable. Anyone can make a beautiful mockup; making it perform in production is the actual skill.</p>

<p><strong>Green flag:</strong> An agency that shows you websites with measurable results — "this site now ranks first in Paris for X keyword" or "this redesign increased enquiries by 40%" — demonstrates that they think beyond aesthetics and understand business outcomes.</p>

<h2>2. Understand Their Technology Stack</h2>

<p>The technologies an agency uses directly impact your site's performance, security, long-term maintainability, and how much you will pay for changes in the future. Here is what to look for:</p>

<h3>Modern Frontend Frameworks</h3>
<p>In 2026, leading agencies use frameworks like <a href="/en/technologies/react">React</a>, <a href="/en/technologies/nextjs">Next.js</a>, Astro, or Vue.js — not because they are trendy, but because they deliver measurably better performance and give developers precise control over every pixel and millisecond. If an agency is building everything on jQuery, basic HTML templates, or five-year-old WordPress page builders, they are operating with tools that put an artificial ceiling on what your site can achieve.</p>

<h3>Styling Approach</h3>
<p>Agencies using <a href="/en/technologies/tailwind-css">Tailwind CSS</a> or well-structured CSS architectures typically deliver more consistent, maintainable designs. Ask about their approach to responsive design — do they design mobile-first (starting with the smallest screen and scaling up) or do they design desktop-first and shrink down? Mobile-first is the correct approach for European markets where mobile traffic exceeds 60%.</p>

<h3>Backend and Infrastructure</h3>
<p>For most European SMBs, a modern backend like <a href="/en/technologies/supabase">Supabase</a> (managed PostgreSQL with built-in auth and edge functions) paired with edge deployment on <a href="/en/technologies/vercel">Vercel</a> or a similar CDN platform provides an excellent combination of performance, security, and cost-efficiency. Be wary of agencies that default to shared hosting from discount providers — these deliver poor performance, unreliable uptime, and inadequate security for business-critical websites.</p>

<h3>TypeScript and Code Quality</h3>
<p>Ask whether the agency uses <a href="/en/technologies/typescript">TypeScript</a>. It is not just a developer preference — TypeScript catches entire categories of bugs before they reach production, resulting in more reliable websites with fewer post-launch issues. Agencies that use TypeScript consistently are signalling that they care about code quality and long-term maintainability, not just getting something deployed quickly.</p>

<h3>Ownership and Portability</h3>
<p>Ask explicitly: if you decide to work with a different agency in three years, will you own all the code and be able to take it elsewhere? Or are you locked into their proprietary system, hosting, or CMS? Reputable agencies deliver code you own entirely. Some agencies build their clients' sites on proprietary platforms that make migration essentially impossible without a full rebuild — this is a business model designed to create dependency, not serve your interests.</p>

<h2>3. Assess Multilingual and Multi-Market Capabilities</h2>

<p>If you operate across European markets, <a href="/en/blog/multilingual-guide">multilingual capabilities</a> are essential — and the gap between agencies that do this well and those that do it poorly is substantial.</p>

<p>Many agencies treat translation as an afterthought, bolting on a plugin after the site is built. This approach leads to predictable problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Broken layouts when text expands (German text is typically 30% longer than English; French text is 15–20% longer)</li>
<li>Poor SEO because hreflang tags are missing, misconfigured, or pointing to non-existent URLs</li>
<li>Inconsistent user experience across language versions — the French site feels like a translation, not a native experience</li>
<li>Maintenance complexity when content needs updating across multiple language files</li>
<li>URL structures that Google cannot properly associate with specific geographic and language markets</li>
</ul>

<p>A competent agency builds internationalisation (i18n) into the architecture from day one. This means proper locale-based URL structures (/en/, /fr/, /nl/, /de/), correct hreflang implementation, a content management workflow that supports multiple languages efficiently, and ideally, market-specific content rather than purely machine-translated copies of the English text.</p>

<p>When evaluating an agency, ask to see live examples of multilingual sites they have built. Check the French version of their portfolio sites — do they actually rank in French Google? Is the French content natural, or obviously machine-translated?</p>

<h2>4. Check Their SEO Knowledge</h2>

<p>A beautiful website that nobody finds is a failed investment. Your agency should demonstrate deep, current knowledge of search engine optimisation — not just surface-level familiarity with keywords and meta descriptions.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Technical SEO:</strong> proper heading hierarchy, semantic HTML5 structure, structured data (JSON-LD for Organization, LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ, Review schemas), sitemap generation, robots.txt, canonical URLs, and <a href="/en/blog/core-web-vitals-guide">Core Web Vitals optimisation</a></li>
<li><strong>On-page SEO:</strong> meta titles within 50–60 characters, meta descriptions within 150–160 characters, unique H1 per page, descriptive alt text on images, internal linking strategy</li>
<li><strong>International SEO:</strong> hreflang tags for multilingual sites, country-specific keyword research (search behaviour differs significantly between French and Belgian French speakers, or British and American English), localized content strategies that match regional intent</li>
<li><strong>Performance SEO:</strong> page speed optimisation, image compression and WebP/AVIF formats, lazy loading, code splitting, font loading strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask the agency for Lighthouse scores on their recent projects — and verify them yourself by running the URLs through Google PageSpeed Insights before your meeting. Agencies that consistently deliver 90+ scores across performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO take the full picture of web quality seriously, not just the aesthetics.</p>

<h2>5. Evaluate Communication and Process</h2>

<p>The agency-client relationship for a web project typically spans 4–16 weeks of active collaboration, followed by years of support interactions. Communication quality matters enormously throughout both phases.</p>

<h3>Response Time as a Signal</h3>
<p>How quickly did they respond to your initial enquiry? If it takes a week to get a reply before you are even a client, the response time after you have signed the contract and paid your deposit will almost certainly be slower. Agencies with good processes respond to new enquiries within 24 hours on business days.</p>

<h3>Project Management Approach</h3>
<p>Ask about their project management tools and process. Strong agencies use structured workflows with clear milestones, defined feedback cycles, and documented deliverables. You should always know where your project stands — what has been completed, what is in progress, what decisions are waiting for your input. Vague answers like "we'll keep you updated" without specifics suggest ad-hoc project management that frequently leads to missed deadlines and scope confusion.</p>

<h3>The Brief and Discovery Process</h3>
<p>How much does the agency ask about your business before proposing a solution? Agencies that skip discovery and jump straight to quoting based on page count are treating your project as a commodity. Agencies that ask about your target customers, your competitive landscape, your current customer acquisition channels, and your business goals are building the context needed to create a website that actually performs.</p>

<h3>Cultural Understanding for European Markets</h3>
<p>For European businesses operating across national borders, cultural understanding matters practically. An agency that has worked across multiple European markets understands that French business culture values formal relationship-building and detailed documentation; Dutch clients tend to be direct and efficiency-focused; UK businesses prioritise case studies and social proof. These nuances affect how your website content should be written and structured for each market.</p>

<p>There are also regulatory differences: GDPR compliance requirements differ in implementation between France (CNIL), the UK (ICO post-Brexit), Germany (Datenschutzbeauftragter requirements), and Belgium (APD). An agency unfamiliar with these distinctions will produce cookie consent and privacy implementations that are legally non-compliant in specific markets.</p>

<h3>Language Capabilities</h3>
<p>Can the agency communicate in your preferred language? Even if the project is primarily in English, being able to discuss nuances in French, Dutch, or German prevents costly misunderstandings about tone, content positioning, and market-specific requirements.</p>

<h2>6. Understand Their Pricing Model</h2>

<p>European web agency pricing varies dramatically, and the cheapest quote is rarely the best value. Here is how to evaluate pricing intelligently:</p>

<h3>Fixed Price vs Hourly</h3>
<p>Fixed-price projects give you cost certainty and align incentives — the agency is motivated to be efficient rather than to log billable hours. Hourly billing offers flexibility for undefined scope but makes budgeting difficult and creates an incentive for the agency to move slowly. The best agencies for SMBs offer tiered packages with clear deliverables at each level, so you know exactly what you are buying.</p>

<h3>What Is Actually Included</h3>
<p>Always ask what is included in the quoted price. Common gotchas that inflate the final cost include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hosting and domain management (often billed separately or requires a hosting account you set up)</li>
<li>SSL certificate configuration and renewal</li>
<li>Content creation and copywriting (many agencies build the structure but do not write the text)</li>
<li>Photography and graphic design (who provides the imagery?)</li>
<li>Post-launch revisions — how many rounds are included, and what constitutes a revision vs a new feature request?</li>
<li>Training on the content management system</li>
<li>SEO setup vs SEO optimisation vs ongoing SEO management — these are three different things</li>
<li>Cookie consent implementation (required by law in all EU markets)</li>
</ul>

<h3>European Market Rate Context</h3>
<p>For reference, realistic European web agency pricing for quality work in 2026:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Single-page landing site:</strong> €497–€1,200</li>
<li><strong>Multi-page business site (5–7 pages):</strong> €997–€3,500</li>
<li><strong>E-commerce store (up to 500 products):</strong> €2,997–€8,000</li>
<li><strong>Custom platform or enterprise site:</strong> €8,000–€50,000+</li>
<li><strong>Monthly maintenance and support:</strong> €97–€300/month</li>
</ul>

<p>Be suspicious of quotes dramatically below market rate — they typically indicate hidden costs that emerge mid-project, offshore development with a European-facing account manager, low-quality templates being resold as custom work, or developers with insufficient experience to deliver reliably.

<h2>7. Post-Launch Support and Maintenance</h2>

<p>The launch is the beginning of your website's working life, not the end of the project. A website needs ongoing care: security monitoring, content updates, performance maintenance, and SEO adjustments as Google's algorithms evolve. Before signing any contract, establish clearly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do they offer <strong>maintenance plans</strong>? What is included — hosting, updates, backups, content changes, monthly reporting?</li>
<li>What is the response time for urgent issues (site down, form not working, security breach)?</li>
<li>Do they provide <strong>monthly analytics reports</strong> showing traffic, ranking progress, and conversion data?</li>
<li>How do they handle platform updates and security patches?</li>
<li>Is there a <strong>named point of contact</strong> for your account, or do you deal with a rotating support queue?</li>
<li>What happens to your site if the agency closes or is acquired?</li>
</ul>

<p>A good maintenance plan typically costs €97–€200/month and includes managed hosting, regular updates, automated backups, uptime monitoring, and a set number of content changes per month. This is significantly cheaper than paying hourly rates for ad-hoc support whenever something needs changing — and the relationship continuity means the agency understands your business and makes changes faster.</p>

<h2>8. Verify GDPR and Legal Compliance</h2>

<p>European websites have strict legal requirements that carry real financial penalties for non-compliance. The GDPR provides for fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for serious violations. Your agency must understand and implement:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>GDPR-compliant cookie consent:</strong> Not just a banner, but a proper consent management system that blocks analytics and marketing tracking until explicit consent is given. Pre-ticked boxes are illegal. Consent must be granular, specific, and freely withdrawable.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy policy and legal notices:</strong> Tailored to your specific country's requirements — French mentions légales, UK privacy notices, German Datenschutzerklärung and Impressum are all legally distinct documents with different mandatory content.</li>
<li><strong>Data processing agreements:</strong> If the agency handles personal data on your behalf (which they do during development), a signed DPA (Data Processing Agreement) is legally required under GDPR Article 28.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility standards:</strong> The European Accessibility Act (EAA) requires digital accessibility compliance from June 2025 for many business categories. WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is increasingly mandatory, not optional.</li>
<li><strong>Local hosting requirements:</strong> Some industries (healthcare, legal, financial) face additional data residency requirements that your agency must be aware of and address in their infrastructure recommendations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Ask for Client References</h2>

<p>Do not take the agency's word for their own quality. Ask for references from past clients — specifically clients in similar industries or markets to yours. When speaking with references, ask:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did the project deliver on time and on budget, or were there overruns?</li>
<li>How was communication throughout the project — responsive, proactive, or hard to reach?</li>
<li>Were there any surprises or costs that were not clear at the outset?</li>
<li>How responsive is the agency for post-launch support?</li>
<li>Did the website achieve the business results you were hoping for?</li>
<li>Would you work with them again for your next project?</li>
</ul>

<p>An agency confident in their work will provide references without hesitation. Reluctance to provide references, or providing only written testimonials rather than actual clients you can contact, is worth noting.</p>

<h2>10. Red Flags That Should Stop the Conversation</h2>

<p>Alongside the positive evaluation criteria, these warning signs indicate agencies that are likely to disappoint:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No contract or vague scope:</strong> professional agencies work from detailed written contracts with clear scope, deliverables, payment terms, revision policies, and IP ownership clauses</li>
<li><strong>All payment upfront:</strong> reputable agencies use milestone-based payment — typically 30–50% to start, 30–40% at a defined midpoint, and the remainder on delivery</li>
<li><strong>Cannot explain their process:</strong> if they cannot clearly describe how a project goes from brief to launch, they are probably figuring it out as they go</li>
<li><strong>No questions about your business:</strong> an agency that quotes without understanding your goals is treating you as a transaction</li>
<li><strong>Guarantees specific SEO rankings:</strong> no agency can guarantee specific rankings on Google. Those who promise "first page in 30 days" are either lying or planning to use techniques that will get your site penalised</li>
<li><strong>Portfolio sites that do not load or have broken pages:</strong> an agency that cannot maintain their clients' own websites is not going to maintain yours</li>
<li><strong>Pressure to sign quickly:</strong> "this price is only available this week" is a sales tactic, not a reflection of genuine value</li>
</ul>

<h2>11. The Decision Framework</h2>

<p>After evaluating multiple agencies, use this weighted scoring approach to make an objective comparison:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Portfolio quality and relevance</strong> (25%) — Do their past projects demonstrate the quality level your business needs?</li>
<li><strong>Technical competence</strong> (20%) — Are they using modern, performant technologies that will serve you for 4–5 years?</li>
<li><strong>Communication and process</strong> (20%) — Can you work together effectively over a sustained period?</li>
<li><strong>Pricing and transparency</strong> (15%) — Is pricing fair, clearly defined, and without hidden gotchas?</li>
<li><strong>Post-launch support</strong> (10%) — Will they be genuinely available and responsive after launch?</li>
<li><strong>Multilingual and European market expertise</strong> (10%) — Do they understand the specific requirements of your target markets?</li>
</ol>

<p>Score each agency on a 1–5 scale for each criterion, apply the weights, and compare totals. This removes emotion from the decision and gives you a defensible choice you can explain to colleagues or business partners who were not part of the evaluation process.</p>

<h2>Making Your Decision</h2>

<p>The right agency is not always the cheapest or the most expensive — it is the one that best understands your business, your market, your customers, and your goals. It is also the agency that communicates honestly, delivers what they promise, and treats your project as a business problem to solve rather than a design exercise to complete.</p>

<p>Take the time to evaluate thoroughly. A hasty decision driven by the lowest quote or the slickest sales presentation is one of the most common and costly mistakes European SMBs make in digital investment. The evaluation process itself — the quality of questions an agency asks, how they handle your questions, how clearly they communicate their approach — reveals more than any portfolio piece.</p>
