const content = `<p>Choosing the right web agency is one of the most consequential decisions a European business can make. Your website is often the first touchpoint with potential customers, and the agency you partner with will shape that experience for years to come. With thousands of agencies across Europe — from solo freelancers to multinational firms — finding the right fit requires a structured approach.</p>

<p>This guide walks you through the essential criteria for evaluating web agencies, with a specific focus on what matters for businesses operating in the European market.</p>

<h2>1. Evaluate Their Portfolio — Quality Over Quantity</h2>

<p>The first thing to examine is an agency's portfolio, but don't just count projects — assess their quality. Look for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Design sophistication:</strong> Do their sites look modern, polished, and unique? Or do they rely on templates and generic layouts?</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Open their portfolio sites and run them through <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>. Scores below 80 suggest the agency doesn't prioritize performance.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile experience:</strong> Browse their work on your phone. Is the mobile experience thoughtful or just a shrunken desktop version?</li>
<li><strong>Industry relevance:</strong> Have they built sites for businesses similar to yours? An agency experienced in <a href="/en/industries">your industry</a> will understand your audience better.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Red flag:</strong> If an agency can't show you live, working websites — only static mockups or screenshots — proceed with caution. A <a href="/en/portfolio">real portfolio</a> of deployed projects is non-negotiable.</p>

<h2>2. Understand Their Technology Stack</h2>

<p>The technologies an agency uses directly impact your site's performance, security, and long-term maintainability. Here's what to look for:</p>

<h3>Modern Frameworks</h3>
<p>In 2026, leading agencies use frameworks like <a href="/en/technologies/react">React</a>, <a href="/en/technologies/nextjs">Next.js</a>, or Vue.js — not because they're trendy, but because they deliver measurably better performance and developer experience. If an agency is still building everything on jQuery or basic HTML templates, they're behind the curve.</p>

<h3>Styling Approach</h3>
<p>Agencies using <a href="/en/technologies/tailwind-css">Tailwind CSS</a> or similar utility-first frameworks typically deliver more consistent, maintainable designs. Ask about their CSS architecture — it reveals a lot about their attention to detail.</p>

<h3>Backend and Infrastructure</h3>
<p>For most European SMBs, a modern backend like <a href="/en/technologies/supabase">Supabase</a> (with PostgreSQL) paired with edge deployment on <a href="/en/technologies/vercel">Vercel</a> provides the best combination of performance, security, and cost-efficiency. Be wary of agencies that default to outdated shared hosting solutions.</p>

<h3>TypeScript</h3>
<p>Ask whether the agency uses <a href="/en/technologies/typescript">TypeScript</a>. It's not just a developer preference — TypeScript catches bugs before they reach production, resulting in more reliable websites with fewer post-launch issues.</p>

<h2>3. Assess Multilingual and Multi-Market Capabilities</h2>

<p>If you operate across European markets, <a href="/en/blog/multilingual-guide">multilingual capabilities</a> are essential. Many agencies treat translation as an afterthought, bolting on a plugin after the site is built. This approach leads to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Broken layouts when text expands (German text is typically 30% longer than English)</li>
<li>Poor SEO because hreflang tags are missing or misconfigured</li>
<li>Inconsistent user experience across languages</li>
<li>Maintenance nightmares when content needs updating</li>
</ul>

<p>A competent agency builds internationalization (i18n) into the architecture from day one, with proper URL structures (/en/, /fr/, /de/), hreflang implementation, and a content management workflow that supports multiple languages efficiently.</p>

<h2>4. Check Their SEO Knowledge</h2>

<p>A beautiful website that nobody finds is a failed investment. Your agency should demonstrate deep understanding of:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Technical SEO:</strong> Proper heading hierarchy, semantic HTML, structured data (JSON-LD), sitemap generation, and <a href="/en/blog/core-web-vitals-guide">Core Web Vitals optimization</a></li>
<li><strong>On-page SEO:</strong> Meta titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, canonical URLs</li>
<li><strong>International SEO:</strong> Hreflang tags, country-specific keyword research, localized content strategies</li>
<li><strong>Performance SEO:</strong> Page speed optimization, image compression, lazy loading, code splitting</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask the agency for Lighthouse scores on their recent projects. Agencies that consistently deliver 90+ scores across all categories take SEO seriously. You can verify their claims by running their portfolio sites through <a href="/en/services/technical-seo">technical SEO audits</a> yourself.</p>

<h2>5. Evaluate Communication and Process</h2>

<p>The agency-client relationship is a partnership that typically lasts months or years. Communication quality matters enormously:</p>

<h3>Response Time</h3>
<p>How quickly did they respond to your initial inquiry? If it takes a week to get a reply before you're even a client, imagine the response times after you've signed the contract.</p>

<h3>Project Management</h3>
<p>Ask about their project management tools and process. Good agencies use structured workflows with clear milestones, regular updates, and defined feedback cycles. You should always know where your project stands.</p>

<h3>Cultural Fit</h3>
<p>For European businesses, cultural understanding matters. An agency that has worked across multiple European markets understands the nuances — from GDPR compliance differences between France (CNIL) and the UK (ICO), to design preferences that vary by country and industry.</p>

<h3>Language Capabilities</h3>
<p>Can the agency communicate in your preferred language? Even if the project is in English, being able to discuss nuances in French, Dutch, or German can prevent costly misunderstandings.</p>

<h2>6. Understand Their Pricing Model</h2>

<p>European web agency pricing varies dramatically. Here's how to evaluate it:</p>

<h3>Fixed Price vs. Hourly</h3>
<p>Fixed-price projects give you cost certainty but can lead to scope disputes. Hourly billing offers flexibility but makes budgeting harder. The best agencies offer tiered packages with clear deliverables at each level.</p>

<h3>What's Included</h3>
<p>Always ask what's included in the quoted price. Common gotchas include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hosting and domain management (often extra)</li>
<li>SSL certificates</li>
<li>Content creation and copywriting</li>
<li>Stock photography or custom graphics</li>
<li>Post-launch revisions (how many?)</li>
<li>Training on content management</li>
</ul>

<h3>European Market Rates</h3>
<p>For context, typical European web agency pricing in 2026:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Single-page landing:</strong> €300–€800</li>
<li><strong>Multi-page business site:</strong> €800–€3,000</li>
<li><strong>E-commerce:</strong> €2,000–€10,000</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise/custom:</strong> €10,000+</li>
</ul>

<p>Be suspicious of quotes that are dramatically below market rate — they often indicate hidden costs, offshore outsourcing, or use of low-quality templates. Check our <a href="/en/pricing">transparent pricing</a> to see what fair market rates look like.</p>

<h2>7. Post-Launch Support and Maintenance</h2>

<p>The launch is just the beginning. A website needs ongoing care: security updates, content changes, performance monitoring, and SEO adjustments. Ask potential agencies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do they offer <strong>maintenance plans</strong>? What's included?</li>
<li>What's the response time for urgent issues (site down, security breach)?</li>
<li>Do they provide <strong>monthly reports</strong> on performance and analytics?</li>
<li>How do they handle CMS updates and security patches?</li>
<li>Is there a dedicated point of contact, or do you deal with a rotating support team?</li>
</ul>

<p>A good maintenance plan typically costs €50–€150/month and includes hosting, updates, backups, and a set number of content changes. This is far cheaper than paying hourly rates for ad-hoc support.</p>

<h2>8. Verify GDPR and Legal Compliance</h2>

<p>European websites have strict legal requirements. Your agency must understand and implement:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>GDPR-compliant cookie consent:</strong> Not just a banner, but a proper consent management platform that blocks tracking until consent is given</li>
<li><strong>Privacy policy and legal notices:</strong> Tailored to your specific country's requirements</li>
<li><strong>Data processing agreements:</strong> If the agency handles personal data on your behalf</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility standards:</strong> WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is increasingly mandatory across Europe</li>
</ul>

<p>For a comprehensive checklist, see our <a href="/en/blog/gdpr-checklist">GDPR compliance guide</a>.</p>

<h2>9. Ask for Client References</h2>

<p>Don't just take the agency's word for it. Ask for references from past clients — specifically clients in similar industries or markets. When speaking with references, ask:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did the project deliver on time and on budget?</li>
<li>How was the communication throughout the project?</li>
<li>Were there any surprises or hidden costs?</li>
<li>How responsive is the agency for post-launch support?</li>
<li>Would you work with them again?</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. The Decision Framework</h2>

<p>After evaluating multiple agencies, use this weighted scoring framework:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Portfolio quality and relevance</strong> (25%) — Do their past projects match your needs?</li>
<li><strong>Technical competence</strong> (20%) — Are they using modern, performant technologies?</li>
<li><strong>Communication and process</strong> (20%) — Can you work together effectively?</li>
<li><strong>Pricing and transparency</strong> (15%) — Is the pricing fair and clearly defined?</li>
<li><strong>Post-launch support</strong> (10%) — Will they be there after launch?</li>
<li><strong>Multilingual/European expertise</strong> (10%) — Do they understand your market?</li>
</ol>

<p>Score each agency on a 1-5 scale for each criterion, apply the weights, and compare the totals. This removes emotion from the decision and gives you a defensible choice.</p>

<h2>Making Your Decision</h2>

<p>The right agency isn't always the cheapest or the most expensive — it's the one that best understands your business, your market, and your goals. Take the time to evaluate thoroughly, and you'll build a partnership that delivers real value for years to come.</p>
