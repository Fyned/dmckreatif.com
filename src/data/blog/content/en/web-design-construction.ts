<h2>Why Construction Companies Need Exceptional Websites</h2>

<p>Construction is a visual, trust-driven industry. Your potential clients want to see <strong>what you have built, how you work, and why they should choose you</strong> over competitors. Yet the majority of construction company websites fail to communicate these things effectively — they are slow, outdated, difficult to navigate on mobile, and do little to convert visitors into leads.</p>

<p>This guide covers the best practices for construction company web design, drawn from our experience building sites for construction and renovation businesses across Europe, including <strong>CAKIR Facades</strong> (<a href="https://cakirfacades.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cakirfacades.fr</a>) in France and <strong>Archi Construction & Veranda</strong> (<a href="https://archi.constructionveranda.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">archi.constructionveranda.com</a>) in Belgium.</p>

<h2>Portfolio Galleries That Win Projects</h2>

<p>Your completed projects are your most powerful sales tool. How you present them determines whether a visitor requests a quote or leaves for a competitor.</p>

<h3>High-Quality Project Photography</h3>

<p>Invest in professional photography of your completed projects. This is non-negotiable. A single set of professional photos costs €300–800 and will generate leads for years. Each project should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wide establishing shots</strong> showing the full scope of work</li>
  <li><strong>Detail shots</strong> highlighting craftsmanship and materials</li>
  <li><strong>Context shots</strong> showing the project in its environment</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple angles</strong> to give a complete picture</li>
</ul>

<h3>Before and After Showcases</h3>

<p>For renovation and facade companies, <strong>before/after comparisons</strong> are incredibly effective. They visually demonstrate the transformation your work delivers. Implementation options include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Slider comparisons:</strong> an interactive slider that lets visitors drag between before and after images</li>
  <li><strong>Side-by-side layouts:</strong> clean two-column layouts on desktop, stacked on mobile</li>
  <li><strong>Project timelines:</strong> showing key stages from initial state through completion</li>
</ul>

<p>On the CAKIR Facades website, we implemented full-width project showcases with high-resolution images that load progressively — maintaining fast page speeds while delivering visual impact.</p>

<h3>Project Case Studies</h3>

<p>Go beyond simple photo galleries by creating <strong>detailed case studies</strong> for your best projects. Each case study should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Project overview:</strong> location, scope, duration, and budget range</li>
  <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> what the client needed and why it was complex</li>
  <li><strong>Solution:</strong> your approach, materials chosen, techniques used</li>
  <li><strong>Results:</strong> completed work with measurable outcomes (energy savings, property value increase, etc.)</li>
  <li><strong>Client testimonial:</strong> a quote from the satisfied client</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lead Generation: Turning Visitors Into Clients</h2>

<p>A beautiful website means nothing if it does not generate enquiries. Construction company websites should make it <strong>effortless for potential clients to contact you</strong>.</p>

<h3>Quote Request Forms</h3>

<p>Your quote request form should be prominently placed and simple to complete. Include only essential fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name and contact details (phone + email)</li>
  <li>Project type (dropdown: renovation, new build, facade, extension, etc.)</li>
  <li>Project location (important for local contractors)</li>
  <li>Brief description (text area)</li>
  <li>Optional: photo upload for the current state of the property</li>
  <li>Preferred contact method and time</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid long forms with unnecessary fields. Every additional field reduces form completion rates by approximately <strong>10%</strong>.</p>

<h3>Click-to-Call and WhatsApp</h3>

<p>Construction clients often prefer to <strong>call directly</strong> rather than fill out forms. Make your phone number clickable on mobile devices with <code>tel:</code> links. Consider adding a <strong>WhatsApp Business button</strong> — particularly effective in French and Belgian markets where WhatsApp usage is high among homeowners.</p>

<h3>Strategic CTA Placement</h3>

<p>Place calls-to-action throughout your site, not just on the contact page:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hero section:</strong> primary CTA above the fold ("Get a Free Quote")</li>
  <li><strong>After each project showcase:</strong> "Want similar results? Contact us"</li>
  <li><strong>Service pages:</strong> CTA after describing each service</li>
  <li><strong>Sticky header or floating button:</strong> always-visible contact option on mobile</li>
  <li><strong>Footer:</strong> full contact information with embedded Google Map</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mobile-First Design: Where Your Clients Browse</h2>

<p>Over <strong>70% of construction website traffic comes from mobile devices</strong>. Homeowners searching for contractors typically do so from their phones — often standing in the room they want renovated. Your website must be flawless on mobile:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Touch-friendly navigation:</strong> buttons and links large enough for thumbs (minimum 44x44px tap targets)</li>
  <li><strong>Fast loading on mobile networks:</strong> optimized images (WebP format), lazy loading, and minimal JavaScript</li>
  <li><strong>Readable text:</strong> no pinching to zoom, body text at 16px minimum</li>
  <li><strong>Thumb-zone CTAs:</strong> place important buttons in the lower portion of the screen where thumbs naturally reach</li>
  <li><strong>Simplified navigation:</strong> hamburger menu with clear hierarchy, maximum 2 levels deep</li>
</ul>

<h2>SEO for Construction Companies</h2>

<p>Construction is a <strong>local business</strong>. Your SEO strategy should focus on appearing in search results when people in your service area search for your services.</p>

<h3>Local SEO Essentials</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Business Profile:</strong> complete, verified, with photos, services, and regular posts</li>
  <li><strong>Location-specific pages:</strong> create pages for each city or region you serve (e.g., "Facade Renovation in Lyon", "Construction Company in Brussels")</li>
  <li><strong>NAP consistency:</strong> your Name, Address, and Phone number must be identical across your website, Google Business, and all directories</li>
  <li><strong>Local schema markup:</strong> <a href="https://schema.org/LocalBusiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LocalBusiness schema</a> helps search engines understand your business type, location, and service area</li>
  <li><strong>Reviews integration:</strong> display Google reviews on your site to build trust and improve local search rankings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Service-Specific Landing Pages</h3>

<p>Create dedicated pages for each service you offer. Instead of listing all services on one page, build individual pages for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Facade renovation / ravalement de facade</li>
  <li>Home extensions / agrandissement</li>
  <li>Kitchen renovation</li>
  <li>Bathroom renovation</li>
  <li>Roofing / toiture</li>
  <li>Insulation / isolation</li>
</ul>

<p>Each page should have unique content, relevant keywords, project photos for that specific service, and a dedicated quote request form. This approach dramatically improves search visibility for specific service queries.</p>

<h2>Trust Signals That Convert</h2>

<p>Construction involves significant investment and letting strangers into your home. <strong>Trust is everything.</strong> Your website should prominently display:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Certifications and qualifications:</strong> RGE (France), BENOR (Belgium), professional body memberships</li>
  <li><strong>Insurance information:</strong> decennale (10-year guarantee in France), liability insurance</li>
  <li><strong>Client testimonials:</strong> with full names and project details where possible</li>
  <li><strong>Years of experience:</strong> and number of completed projects</li>
  <li><strong>Team photos:</strong> showing real people builds personal connection</li>
  <li><strong>Guarantees:</strong> workmanship warranties, satisfaction guarantees</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Performance Matters</h2>

<p>Construction websites are image-heavy, which makes performance optimization critical:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Image optimization:</strong> serve WebP/AVIF formats, use responsive srcset attributes, implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images</li>
  <li><strong>Core Web Vitals:</strong> aim for LCP under 2.5 seconds — critical for Google rankings</li>
  <li><strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN):</strong> serve images from edge servers closest to your visitors</li>
  <li><strong>Minimal JavaScript:</strong> construction sites rarely need complex interactivity — keep the bundle small</li>
</ul>
