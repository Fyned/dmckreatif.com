# DMC KREATIF — Visual Design Rules for Slide & Story Creation

## CRITICAL: Every Visual MUST Follow These Rules

This document tells NotebookLM exactly how to design slides that match the DMC Kreatif NeoBrutalist brand identity. Use these rules for EVERY slide, story, post, or visual content.

---

## Slide Layout Rules

### Background
- Primary: Cream (#FFFDF5) with subtle dot grid pattern
- Alternative: Solid black (#121212) for contrast/urgency slides
- NEVER use gradients, blurs, or photographic backgrounds
- NEVER use rounded corners anywhere

### Borders & Shadows
- EVERY card, box, button, banner MUST have a thick black border (3-4px)
- EVERY elevated element MUST have a hard drop shadow: `offset 4-8px right, 4-8px down, solid black, NO BLUR`
- Shadow gives a "stacked paper" or "sticker" effect

### Typography Rules
- ALL headings: UPPERCASE, bold, Space Grotesk or similar geometric sans-serif
- Body text: Monospace font (JetBrains Mono style) for technical/label feel
- Maximum 3-4 words per headline for impact
- Code-style labels like `>_ SERVICE_01` or `SYS.PRICING` for section markers
- Letter spacing: tight for headings, wide for labels

### Color Usage Per Slide Type
| Slide Purpose | Primary Color | Accent |
|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Hero / Title | Lime (#CDFF50) | Black (#121212) |
| Web Development | Lime (#CDFF50) | Black |
| E-Commerce | Yellow (#FBFF48) | Black |
| SEO | Blue (#3B82F6) | White text |
| Marketing | Pink (#FF70A6) | Black |
| Urgency/Sale | Black bg (#121212) | Lime (#CDFF50) |
| CTA / Close | Lime (#CDFF50) | Black |

| Premium/Commerce | Purple (#A855F7) | White text |
